# Get devices onboarded to Microsoft Defender ATP

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2146631)

Each onboarded device adds an additional endpoint detection and response (EDR) sensor and increases visibility over breach activity in your network. Onboarding also ensures that a device can be checked for vulnerable components as well security configuration issues and can receive critical remediation actions during attacks.

Before you can track and manage onboarding of devices:
- [Enroll your devices to Intune management](configure-machines.md#enroll-devices-to-intune-management)
- [Ensure you have the necessary permissions](configure-machines.md#obtain-required-permissions)

## Discover and track unprotected devices

The **Onboarding** card provides a high-level overview of your onboarding rate by comparing the number of Windows 10 devices that have actually onboarded to Microsoft Defender ATP against the total number of Intune-managed Windows 10 devices.

>[!NOTE]
>If you used Security Center Configuration Manager, the onboarding script, or other onboarding methods that donâ€™t use Intune profiles, you might encounter data discrepancies. To resolve these discrepancies, create a corresponding Intune configuration profile for Microsoft Defender ATP onboarding and assign that profile to your devices.

## Onboard more devices with Intune profiles

Microsoft Defender ATP provides several convenient options for [onboarding Windows 10 devices](onboard-configure.md). For Intune-managed devices, however, you can leverage Intune profiles to conveniently deploy the Microsoft Defender ATP sensor to select devices, effectively onboarding these devices to the service.

From the **Onboarding** card, select **Onboard more devices** to create and assign a profile on Intune. The link takes you to the device compliance page on Intune, which provides a similar overview of your onboarding state.

>[!TIP]
>Alternatively, you can navigate to the Microsoft Defender ATP onboarding compliance page in the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) from **All services > Intune > Device compliance > Microsoft Defender ATP**.

>[!NOTE]
> If you want to view the most up-to-date device data, click on **List of devices without ATP sensor**.

From the device compliance page, create a configuration profile specifically for the deployment of the Microsoft Defender ATP sensor and assign that profile to the devices you want to onboard. To do this, you can either:

- Select **Create a device configuration profile to configure ATP sensor** to start with a predefined device configuration profile.
- Create the device configuration profile from scratch.
