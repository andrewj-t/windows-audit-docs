# Review and approve actions following an automated investigation

## Remediation actions

When an automated investigation runs, a verdict is generated for each piece of evidence investigated. Verdicts can be *Malicious*, *Suspicious*, or *No threats found*. Depending on the type of threat, the resulting verdict, and how your organization's [device groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/machine-groups) are configured, remediation actions can occur automatically or only upon approval by your organizationâ€™s security operations team. Here are two examples:

- Example 1: Contoso's devices are included in a device group that is set for **Semi - require approval for any remediation**. In this case, Contoso's security operations team must review and approve all remediation actions. (See [Review pending actions](#review-pending-actions).)

- Example 2: Fabrikam's device groups are set to **Full - remediate threats automatically** (this is the recommended setting). In this case, remediation actions are taken automatically for artifacts that are considered to be malicious. (See [Review completed actions](#review-completed-actions).)

### Automated investigation results and remediation actions

The following table summarizes remediation actions following an automated investigation, and how device group settings affect whether actions are taken automatically or upon approval. 

|Device group setting | Automated investigation results | What to do |
|:---|:---|:---|
|**Full - remediate threats automatically** (this is the recommended setting) |A verdict of *Malicious* is reached for a piece of evidence. <br/><br/>Depending on the artifact, one of the following remediation actions are taken automatically: <br/>- Quarantine a file <br/>- Remove a registry key <br/>- Kill a process <br/>- Stop a service <br/>- Remove a registry key <br/>- Disable a driver <br/>- Remove a scheduled task |[Review completed actions](#review-completed-actions). |
