# Review and approve actions following an automated investigation

## Remediation actions

When an automated investigation runs, a verdict is generated for each piece of evidence investigated. Verdicts can be *Malicious*, *Suspicious*, or *No threats found*. Depending on the type of threat and resulting verdict, remediation actions occur automatically or upon approval by your organizationâ€™s security operations team. For example, some actions, such as removing malware, are taken automatically. Other actions require review and approval to proceed.  

When a verdict of *Malicious* is reached for a piece of evidence, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection takes one of the following remediation actions automatically:
- Quarantine a file
- Remove a registry key
- Kill a process
- Stop a service
- Remove a registry key
- Disable a driver
- Remove a scheduled task

Evidence determined as *Suspicious* results in pending actions that require approval. As a best practice, make sure to [approve (or reject) pending actions](#review-pending-actions) as soon as possible so that you automated investigations complete in a timely manner. 

No actions are taken when a verdict of *No threats found* is reached for a piece of evidence. 

In Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, all verdicts are [tracked and viewable in the Microsoft Defender Security Center](#review-completed-actions).

## Review pending actions

1. Go to the Microsoft Defender Security Center ([https://securitycenter.windows.com](https://securitycenter.windows.com)) and sign in. You'll see the Security dashboard.

2. On the Security dashboard, in the navigation pane on the left, choose **Automated investigations** > **Action center**.

3. Review any items on the **Pending** tab.

From the panel, you can click on the **Open investigation page** link to see the investigation details.

    You can also select multiple investigations to approve or reject actions on multiple investigations.
