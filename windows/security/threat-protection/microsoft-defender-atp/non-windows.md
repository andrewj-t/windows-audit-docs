# Microsoft Defender ATP for non-Windows platforms
**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)


Microsoft has been on a journey to extend its industry leading endpoint security
capabilities beyond Windows and Windows Server to macOS, Linux, Android, and
soon iOS.

Organizations face threats across a variety of platforms and devices. Our teams
have committed to building security solutions not just *for* Microsoft, but also
*from* Microsoft to enable our customers to protect and secure their entire
organizations. We're listening to customer feedback and partnering closely with
our customers to build solutions that meet their needs.

Customers highly value the unified view of all threats and alerts in the
Microsoft Defender Security Center, across Windows and non-Windows platforms, enabling them to get a full picture of what's happening in their
environment, which empowers them to more quickly assess and respond to threats.

## Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac 

Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac offers antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities for the three
latest released versions of macOS. Customers can deploy and manage the solution
through Microsoft Endpoint Manager, and Jamf. Just like with Microsoft Office
applications on macOS, Microsoft Auto Update is used to manage Microsoft
Defender ATP for Mac updates. For information about the key features and
benefits, read our

16 LTS, or higher LTS, SLES 12+, Debian 9+, and Oracle Linux 7.2. Microsoft
