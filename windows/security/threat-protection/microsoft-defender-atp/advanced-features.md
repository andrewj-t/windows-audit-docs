# Configure advanced features in Microsoft Defender ATP

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

>Want to experience Microsoft Defender ATP? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp?ocid=docs-wdatp-advancedfeats-abovefoldlink)

Depending on the Microsoft security products that you use, some advanced features might be available for you to integrate Microsoft Defender ATP with.

Use the following advanced features to get better protected from potentially malicious files and gain better insight during security investigations:

## Automated investigation

Turn on this feature to take advantage of the automated investigation and remediation features of the service. For more information, see [Automated investigation](automated-investigations.md).

## Live response

Turn on this feature so that users with the appropriate permissions can start a live response session on devices.

For more information about role assignments, see [Create and manage roles](user-roles.md).

## Live response unsigned script execution

Enabling this feature allows you to run unsigned scripts in a live response session.

## Autoresolve remediated alerts

For tenants created on or after Windows 10, version 1809 the automated investigation and remediation capability is configured by default to resolve alerts where the automated analysis result status is "No threats found" or "Remediated".  If you don't want to have alerts auto-resolved, you'll need to manually turn off the feature.

>[!TIP]
>For tenants created prior that version, you'll need to manually turn this feature on from the [Advanced features](https://securitycenter.windows.com/preferences2/integration) page.

>[!NOTE]
>
>- The result of the auto-resolve action may influence the Device risk level calculation which is based on the active alerts found on a device.  
>- If a security operations analyst manually sets the status of an alert to "In progress" or "Resolved" the auto-resolve capability will not overwrite it.

## Allow or block file

Blocking is only available if your organization fulfills these requirements:

- Uses Microsoft Defender Antivirus as the active antimalware solution and,
- The cloud-based protection feature is enabled

This feature enables you to block potentially malicious files in your network. Blocking a file will prevent it from being read, written, or executed on devices in your organization.

To turn **Allow or block** files on:

1. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** > **Advanced features** > **Allow or block file**.

1. Toggle the setting between **On** and **Off**.

1. Select **Save preferences** at the bottom of the page.

After turning on this feature, you can [block files](respond-file-alerts.md#allow-or-block-file) via the **Add Indicator** tab on a file's profile page.

## Custom network indicators

Turning on this feature allows you to create indicators for IP addresses, domains, or URLs, which determine whether they will be allowed or blocked based on your custom indicator list.

To use this feature, devices must be running Windows 10 version 1709 or later. They should also have network protection in block mode and version 4.18.1906.3 or later of the antimalware platform [see KB 4052623](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099834).

For more information, see [Manage indicators](manage-indicators.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Network protection leverages reputation services that process requests in locations that might be outside of the location you have selected for your Microsoft Defender ATP data.

## Show user details

Turn on this feature so that you can see user details stored in Azure Active Directory. Details include a user's picture, name, title, and department information  when investigating user account entities. You can find user account information in the following views:

- Security operations dashboard
- Alert queue
- Device details page

For more information, see [Investigate a user account](investigate-user.md).

## Skype for Business integration

Enabling the Skype for Business integration gives you the ability to communicate with users using Skype for Business, email, or phone. This can be handy when you need to communicate with the user and mitigate risks.

>[!NOTE]
> When a device is being isolated from the network, there's a pop-up where you can choose to enable Outlook and Skype communications which allows communications to the user while they are disconnected from the network. This setting applies to Skype and Outlook communication when devices are in isolation mode.

## Azure Advanced Threat Protection integration

The integration with Azure Advanced Threat Protection allows you to pivot directly into another Microsoft Identity security product. Azure Advanced Threat Protection augments an investigation with additional insights about a suspected compromised account and related resources. By enabling this feature, you'll enrich the device-based investigation capability by pivoting across the network from an identify point of view.

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need to have the appropriate license to enable this feature.

## Microsoft Secure Score

Forwards Microsoft Defender ATP signals to Microsoft Secure Score in the Microsoft 365 security center. Turning on this feature gives Microsoft Secure Score visibility into the devices security posture. Forwarded data is stored and processed in the same location as the your Microsoft Secure Score data.

### Enable the Microsoft Defender ATP integration from the Azure ATP portal

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.atp.azure.com/) with a Global Administrator or Security Administrator role.

2. Click **Create your instance**.

3. Toggle the Integration setting to **On** and click **Save**.

After completing the integration steps on both portals, you'll be able to see relevant alerts in the device details or user details page.

## Office 365 Threat Intelligence connection

This feature is only available if you have an active Office 365 E5 or the Threat Intelligence add-on. For more information, see the Office 365 Enterprise E5 product page.

When you turn this feature on, you'll be able to incorporate data from Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection into Microsoft Defender Security Center to conduct a comprehensive security investigation across Office 365 mailboxes and Windows devices.

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need to have the appropriate license to enable this feature. 

To receive contextual device integration in Office 365 Threat Intelligence, you'll need to enable the Microsoft Defender ATP settings in the Security & Compliance dashboard.

## Microsoft Threat Experts

Out of the two Microsoft Threat Expert components, targeted attack notification is in general availability. Experts-on-demand capability is still in preview. You can only use the experts-on-demand capability if you have applied for preview and your application has been approved. You can receive targeted attack notifications from Microsoft Threat Experts through your Microsoft Defender ATP portal's alerts dashboard and via email if you configure it.

>[!NOTE]
>The Microsoft Threat Experts capability in Microsoft Defender ATP is available with an E5 license for [Enterprise Mobility + Security](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security).

## Microsoft Cloud App Security

Enabling this setting forwards Microsoft Defender ATP signals to Microsoft Cloud App Security to provide deeper visibility into cloud application usage. Forwarded data is stored and processed in the same location as your Cloud App Security data.

>[!NOTE]
>This feature will be available with an E5 license for [Enterprise Mobility + Security](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security) on devices running Windows 10, version 1709 (OS Build 16299.1085 with [KB4493441](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4493441)), Windows 10, version 1803 (OS Build 17134.704 with [KB4493464](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4493464)), Windows 10, version 1809 (OS Build 17763.379 with [KB4489899](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4489899)) or later Windows 10 versions.

## Azure Information Protection

Turning on this setting allows signals to be forwarded to Azure Information Protection. It gives data owners and administrators visibility into protected data on onboarded devices and device risk ratings.

## Microsoft Intune connection

Microsoft Defender ATP can be integrated with [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/what-is-intune) to [enable device risk-based conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/advanced-threat-protection#enable-windows-defender-atp-in-intune). When you [turn on this feature](configure-conditional-access.md), you'll be able to share Microsoft Defender ATP device information with Intune, enhancing policy enforcement.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You'll need to enable the integration on both Intune and Microsoft Defender ATP to use this feature. For more information on specific steps, see [Configure Conditional Access in Microsoft Defender ATP](configure-conditional-access.md).

This feature is only available if you have the following:

- A licensed tenant for Enterprise Mobility + Security E3, and Windows E5 (or Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5)
- An active Microsoft Intune environment, with Intune-managed Windows 10 devices [Azure AD-joined](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join/).

### Conditional Access policy

When you enable Intune integration, Intune will automatically create a classic Conditional Access (CA) policy. This classic CA policy is a prerequisite for setting up status reports to Intune. It should not be deleted.

>[!NOTE]
> The classic CA policy created by Intune is distinct from modern [Conditional Access policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview/), which are used for configuring endpoints.


## Preview features

Learn about new features in the Microsoft Defender ATP preview release and be among the first to try upcoming features by turning on the preview experience.

You'll have access to upcoming features, which you can provide feedback on to help improve the overall experience before features are generally available.

## Share endpoint alerts with Microsoft Compliance Center

Forwards endpoint security alerts and their triage status to Microsoft Compliance Center, allowing you to enhance insider risk management policies with alerts and remediate internal risks before they cause harm. Forwarded data is processed and stored in the same location as your Office 365 data.

After configuring the [Security policy violation indicators](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/insider-risk-management-settings.md#indicators) in the insider risk management settings, Microsoft Defender ATP alerts will be shared with insider risk management for applicable users.
