# Microsoft Defender ATP evaluation lab
**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)


Conducting a comprehensive security product evaluation can be a complex process requiring cumbersome environment and machine configuration before an end-to-end attack simulation can actually be done. Adding to the complexity is the challenge of tracking where the simulation activities, alerts, and results are reflected during the evaluation.

The Microsoft Defender ATP evaluation lab is designed to eliminate the complexities of machine and environment configuration so that you can  focus on evaluating the capabilities of the platform, running simulations, and seeing the prevention, detection, and remediation features in action.

With the simplified set-up experience, you can focus on running your own test scenarios and the pre-made simulations to see how Microsoft Defender ATP performs. 

You'll have full access to the powerful capabilities of the platform such as automated investigations, advanced hunting, and threat analytics, allowing you to test the comprehensive protection stack that Microsoft Defender ATP offers. 

You can add Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 machines. These test machines come pre-configured to have the latest and greatest OS versions with the right security components in place and Office 2019 Standard installed.

You can also install threat simulators. Microsoft Defender ATP has partnered with industry leading threat simulation platforms to help you test out the Microsoft Defender ATP capabilities.  Install your preferred simulator, run scenarios within the evaluation lab, and instantly see how the platform performs. You'll also have convenient access to wide array of simulations which you can access and run from the simulations catalog.

After the lab setup process is complete, you can add machines and run simulations. 


## Add machines
When you add a machine to your environment, Microsoft Defender ATP sets up a well-configured machine with connection details. You can add Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 machines.

The machine will be configured with the most up-to-date version of the OS and Office 2019 Standard as well as other apps such as Java, Python, and SysIntenals. 

If you chose to add a threat simulator during the lab setup, all machines will have the threat simulator agent installed in the machines that you add.

The machine will automatically be onboarded to your tenant with the recommended Windows security components turned on and in audit mode - with no effort on your side. 

  The following security components are pre-configured in the test machines:

- [Attack Surface Reduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard)
- [Block at first sight](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/configure-block-at-first-sight-windows-defender-antivirus)
- [Controlled Folder Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/controlled-folders-exploit-guard)
- [Exploit Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-exploit-protection)
- [Network Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/network-protection-exploit-guard)
- [Potentially unwanted application detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-windows-defender-antivirus)
