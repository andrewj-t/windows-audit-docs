# Deployment phases

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2146631)


There are three phases in deploying Microsoft Defender ATP:

|Phase | Desription | 
|:-------|:-----|
| ![Phase 1: Prepare](images/prepare.png)<br>[Phase 1: Prepare](prepare-deployment.md)| Learn about what you need to consider when deploying Microsoft Defender ATP: <br><br>- Stakeholders and sign-off <br> - Environment considerations <br>- Access <br> - Adoption order
|  ![Phase 2: Setup](images/setup.png) <br>[Phase 2: Setup](production-deployment.md)|  Take the initial steps to access Microsoft Defender Security Center. You'll be guided on:<br><br>- Validating the licensing <br>  - Completing the setup wizard within the portal<br>- Network configuration|
|  ![Phase 3: Onboard](images/onboard.png) <br>[Phase 3: Onboard](onboarding.md) | Onboard devices to the service so the Microsoft Defender ATP service can get sensor data from them. You'll be guided on:<br><br>- Using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager to onboard devices<br>- Configure capabilities 



 The deployment guide will guide you through the recommended path in deploying Microsoft Defender ATP. 

There are several methods you can use to onboard to the service. For information on other ways to onboard, see [Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender ATP](onboard-configure.md).

## In Scope

The following is in scope for this deployment guide:

-   Use of Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager to onboard endpoints into the service

-   Enabling Microsoft Defender ATP endpoint protection platform (EPP)
    capabilities

    -   Next-generation protection

    -   Attack surface reduction

-   Enabling Microsoft Defender ATP endpoint detection and response (EDR)
    capabilities including automatic investigation and remediation

-   Enabling Microsoft Defender ATP threat and vulnerability management (TVM)


## Out of scope

The following are out of scope of this deployment guide:

-   Configuration of third-party solutions that might integrate with Microsoft
    Defender ATP

-   Penetration testing in production environment
