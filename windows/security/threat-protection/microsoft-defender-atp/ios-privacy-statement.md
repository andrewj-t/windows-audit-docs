# Microsoft Defender ATP for iOS note on Privacy

## What information can my organization see when I use Microsoft Defender ATP on iOS

Your organization cannot see your personal information when you use Microsoft Defender ATP. Microsoft Defender ATP sends certain pieces of information from your device to the ATP portal, such as device threat level, device model, and serial number. Your organization uses this information to help protect you from web-based attacks.

**What your organization can never see:**

- Calling and web browsing history
- Email and text messages
- Contacts
- Calendar
- Passwords
- Pictures, including what's in the photos app or camera roll
- Files

**What your organization can see:**

- Malicious Connections that were blocked by Microsoft Defender ATP
- Device model, like iPhone 11
- Operating system and version, like iOS 12.0.1
- Device name
- Device serial number

## VPN Usage

Microsoft Defender ATP for iOS uses VPN in order to provide the Web Protection feature. This is not a regular VPN and is a local/self-looping VPN that does not take traffic outside the device.
