# Weaknesses
**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Threat & Vulnerability Management leverages the same signals in Microsoft Defender ATP's endpoint protection to scan and detect vulnerabilities.

The **Weaknesses** page lists down the vulnerabilities found in the infected software running in your organization, their severity, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) rating, its prevalence in your organization, corresponding breach, and threat insights. 

## Navigate through weaknesses page
1. Go to the Threat & Vulnerability Management navigation menu and select **Weaknesses** to open up the list of vulnerabilities found in your organization.
2. Select the vulnerability that you want to investigate to open up a fly-in page with the vulnerability details, such as: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) description, CVE ID, exploits available, severity, publish, and update dates.
