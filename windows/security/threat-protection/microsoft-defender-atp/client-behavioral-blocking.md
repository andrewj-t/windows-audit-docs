# Client behavioral blocking

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

## Overview

Client behavioral blocking is a component of [behavioral blocking and containment capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/behavioral-blocking-containment) in [Microsoft Defender ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/). As threats are detected on devices (clients), they are blocked and remediated automatically. 

## How client behavioral blocking works




## Configuring client behavioral blocking

If your organization is using Microsoft Defender ATP, feedback-loop blocking is enabled by default. However, rapid protection occurs through a combination of Microsoft Defender ATP capabilities, machine learning protection features, and signal-sharing across Microsoft security services. Make sure the following features and capabilities of Microsoft Defender ATP are enabled and configured:
