# Resources

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) for Linux](microsoft-defender-atp-linux.md)

## Collect diagnostic information

If you can reproduce a problem, please increase the logging level, run the system for some time, and restore the logging level to the default.

1. Increase logging level:

   ```bash
   $ mdatp log level set --level verbose
   Log level configured successfully
   ```

2. Reproduce the problem.

3. Run `sudo mdatp diagnostic create` to back up Microsoft Defender ATP's logs. The files will be stored inside of a .zip archive. This command will also print out the file path to the backup after the operation succeeds:

   ```bash
   $ sudo mdatp diagnostic create
   Diagnostic file created: <path to file>
   ```

4. Restore logging level:

   ```bash
   $ mdatp log level set --level info
   Log level configured successfully
   ```

## Log installation issues

If an error occurs during installation, the installer will only report a general failure.

The detailed log will be saved to `/var/log/microsoft/mdatp_install.log`. If you experience issues during installation, send us this file so we can help diagnose the cause.

## Uninstall

There are several ways to uninstall Microsoft Defender ATP for Linux. If you are using a configuration tool such as Puppet, please follow the package uninstallation instructions for the configuration tool.

### Manual uninstallation

- ```sudo yum remove mdatp``` for RHEL and variants(CentOS and Oracle Linux).
- ```sudo zypper remove mdatp``` for SLES and variants.
- ```sudo apt-get purge mdatp``` for Ubuntu and Debian systems.

## Configure from the command line

Important tasks, such as controlling product settings and triggering on-demand scans, can be done from the command line.

### Global options

By default, the command-line tool outputs the result in human-readable format. In addition to this, the tool also supports outputting the result as JSON, which is useful for automation scenarios. To change the output to JSON, pass `--output json` to any of the below commands.

### Supported commands

The following table lists commands for some of the most common scenarios. Run `mdatp help` from the Terminal to view the full list of supported commands.

### Known issues

- You might see "No sensor data, impaired communications" in the machine information page of the Microsoft Defender Security Center portal, even though the product is working as expected. We are working on addressing this issue.
- Logged on users do not appear in the Microsoft Defender Security Center portal.
- In SUSE distributions, if the installation of *libatomic1* fails, you should validate that your OS is registered:

    ```bash
    $ sudoâ€¯SUSEConnect --status-text
    ```
