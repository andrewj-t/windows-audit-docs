## Use advanced hunting query to search for devices with High active alerts or critical CVE public exploit

1. Go to **Advanced hunting** from the left-hand navigation pane of the Microsoft Defender Security Center.

2. Scroll down to the TVM advanced hunting schemas to familiarize yourself with the column names.

3. Enter the following queries:

```kusto
// Search for devices with High active alerts or Critical CVE public exploit
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities
| join kind=inner(DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilitiesKB) on CveId
| where IsExploitAvailable == 1 and CvssScore >= 7
| summarize NumOfVulnerabilities=dcount(CveId),
DeviceName=any(DeviceName) by DeviceId
| join kind =inner(DeviceAlertEvents) on DeviceId  
| summarize NumOfVulnerabilities=any(NumOfVulnerabilities),
DeviceName=any(DeviceName) by DeviceId, AlertId
| project DeviceName, NumOfVulnerabilities, AlertId  
| order by NumOfVulnerabilities desc

```

## Define a device's value to the organization

Defining a device’s value helps you differentiate between asset priorities. The device value is used to incorporate the risk appetite of an individual asset into the threat and vulnerability management exposure score calculation, so devices marked as “high value” will receive more weight.

Device value options:

- Low
- Normal (Default)
- High

Examples of devices that should be marked as high value:

- Domain controllers, Active Directory
- Internet facing devices
- VIP devices
- Devices hosting internal/external production services

### Set device value

1. Navigate to any device page, the easiest place is from the device inventory.

2. Select **Device Value** from three dots next to the actions bar at the top of the page.

3. A flyout will appear with the current device value and what it means. Review the value of the device and choose the one that best fits your device.
