**Applies to**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

If your organization is using [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/) (Microsoft Defender ATP), [automated investigation and remediation capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/automated-investigations) can save your security operations team time and effort. 

Automated investigation and remediation capabilities mimic the ideal steps that a security analyst takes to investigate and remediate threats:
1. Investigate alerts that were triggered, and analyze evidence.
2. Remediate threats quickly, as appropriate.
3. Resolve alerts as remediation actions are taken, and update investigation status.
4. Find other impacted devices, and repeat steps 1-3 as necessary.
