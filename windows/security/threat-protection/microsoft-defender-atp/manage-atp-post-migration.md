# Manage Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection post migration

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

After you have moved from your previous endpoint protection and antivirus solution to Microsoft Defender ATP, your next step is to manage your features and capabilities. We recommend using Intune to manage your organization's devices and security settings. However, you can use other tools/methods, such as Configuration Manager or Group Policy Objects.
