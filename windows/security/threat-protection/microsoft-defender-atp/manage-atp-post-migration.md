# Manage Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, post migration

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

After you have moved from your previous endpoint protection and antivirus solution to Microsoft Defender ATP, your next step is to manage your features and capabilities. We recommend using [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/endpoint-manager-overview), which includes Intune and Configuration Manager, to manage your organization's devices and security settings. However, you can use other tools/methods, such as Group Policy Objects. 

The following table lists various tools/methods you can use, with links to learn more. 
<br/><br/>

|Tool/Method  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**[Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune)**     |Microsoft Intune, a component of [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/endpoint-manager-overview), focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). With Intune, you control how your organizationâ€™s devices are used, including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. You can also configure specific policies to control applications. <br/><br/>See [Manage Microsoft Defender ATP using Intune](manage-atp-post-migration-intune.md).         |
|**[Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction)**     |Configuration Manager, formerly known as System Center Configuration Manager, is a component of [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/endpoint-manager-overview). Configuration Manager is a complex and powerful tool to manage your users, devices, and software. <br/><br/>See [Manage Microsoft Defender ATP with Configuration Manager](manage-atp-post-migration-configuration-manager.md).        |
|**[Group Policy Objects in Azure Active Directory Domain Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/manage-group-policy)** |[Azure Active Directory Domain Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/overview) includes built-in Group Policy Objects for users and devices. You can customize the built-in Group Policy Objects as needed for your environment, as well as create custom Group Policy Objects and organizational units (OUs). <br/><br/>See [Manage Microsoft Defender ATP with Group Policy Objects](manage-atp-post-migration-group-policy-objects.md). |
|**[PowerShell, WMI, and MPCmdRun.exe](manage-atp-post-migration-other-tools.md)** |You can use PowerShell to manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus, exploit protection, and your attack surface reduction rules. See [Configuring Microsoft Defender ATP with PowerShell](manage-atp-post-migration-other-tools.md#configure-microsoft-defender-atp-with-powershell).<br/><br/>You can use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus and exclusions. See [Configuring Microsoft Defender ATP with WMI](manage-atp-post-migration-other-tools.md#configure-microsoft-defender-atp-with-windows-management-instrumentation-wmi).<br/><br/>You can use the Microsoft Malware Protection Command Line Utility (MPCmdRun.exe) to manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus and exclusions, as well as validate connections between your network and the cloud. See [Configuring Microsoft Defender ATP with MPCmdRun.exe](manage-atp-post-migration-other-tools.md#configure-microsoft-defender-atp-with-microsoft-malware-protection-command-line-utility-mpcmdrunexe). |
