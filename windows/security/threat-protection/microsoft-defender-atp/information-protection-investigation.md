# Use sensitivity labels to investigate incidents  

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

A typical advanced persistent threat lifecycle involves data exfiltration. In a security incident, it's important to have the ability to prioritize investigations where sensitive files may be involved so that corporate data and information are protected.

Microsoft Defender ATP helps to make the prioritization of security incidents where sensitive information are involved easier with the use of sensitivity labels.

1. In Microsoft Defender Security Center, select **Incidents**. 

2. Scroll to the right to see the **Data sensitivity** column. This column reflects sensitivity labels that have been observed on machines related to the incidents providing an indication of whether sensitive files may be impacted by the incident.

3. Open the incident page to further investigate. 

4. Select the **Machines** tab to identify machines storing files with sensitivity labels.
