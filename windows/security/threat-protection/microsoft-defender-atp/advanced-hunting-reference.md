## Advanced hunting table reference

The Advanced hunting schema is made up of multiple tables, which provide either event information or information about certain entities. Table and column names are used for calling information about specific events or entities in queries.

The following reference lists all the tables in the Advanced hunting schema. Each table name links to a page describing the column names for that table.

Table and column names are also listed within the Security center, in the schema representation on the Advanced hunting screen.
