## Endpoint URI and versioning

### Endpoint URI:

> The service base URI is: https://api.securitycenter.windows.com
> 
> The queries based OData have the '/api' prefix. For example, to get Alerts you can send GET request to https://api.securitycenter.windows.com/api/alerts

### Versioning:

> The API supports versioning.
> 
> The current version is **V1.0**.
> 
> To use a specific version, use this format: `https://api.securitycenter.windows.com/api/{Version}`. For example: `https://api.securitycenter.windows.com/api/v1.0/alerts`
> 
> If you don't specify any version (e.g. https://api.securitycenter.windows.com/api/alerts ) you will get to the latest version.
