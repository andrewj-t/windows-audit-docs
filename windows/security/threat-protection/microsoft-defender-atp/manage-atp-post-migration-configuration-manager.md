# Manage Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection with Configuration Manager

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

We recommend using [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) to manage your organization's threat protection features for devices (also referred to as endpoints). However, you can also use [Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction) to manage Microsoft Defender ATP. Both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune are part of [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem), together with Desktop Analytics, and other features & capabilities.
