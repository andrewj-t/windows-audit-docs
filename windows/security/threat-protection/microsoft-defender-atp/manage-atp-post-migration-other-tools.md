# Manage Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection with PowerShell, WMI, and MPCmdRun.exe

We recommend using [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/endpoint-manager-overview), which includes [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) and [Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-protection), to manage your organization's threat protection features in Microsoft Defender ATP. However, you can use PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and the Microsoft Malware Protection Command Line Utility (MPCmdRun.exe) to perform some tasks, such as managing Microsoft Defender Antivirus, or configuring some settings on a device.


## Configure Microsoft Defender ATP with PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus, exploit protection, and your attack surface reduction rules.
