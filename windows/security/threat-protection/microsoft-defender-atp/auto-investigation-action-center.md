# View details and results of automated investigations

Pending and completed [remediation actions](manage-auto-investigation.md#remediation-actions) are listed in the **Action center** ([https://securitycenter.windows.com/action-center](https://securitycenter.windows.com/action-center)) and the **Investigations** page ([https://securitycenter.windows.com/investigations](https://securitycenter.windows.com/investigations)).

>[!NOTE]
>If your organization has implemented role-based access to manage portal access, only authorized users or user groups who have permission to view the machine or machine group will be able to view the entire investigation. 

## The Action center

The action center consists of two main tabs, as described in the following table.

|Tab  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Pending actions     |Displays a list of ongoing investigations that require attention. Recommended actions are presented that your security operations team can approve or reject. <br/><br/>**NOTE**: The Pending tab appears only if there are pending actions to be approved (or rejected).        |
|History     |Acts as an audit log for all of the following: <br/>- All actions taken by automated investigation and remediation in Microsoft Defender ATP <br/>Actions that were approved by your security operations team (some actions, such as sending a file to quarantine, can be undone) <br/>- All commands ran and remediation actions that were applied in Live Response sessions (some actions can be undone) <br/>- Remediation actions that were applied by Windows Defender Antivirus (some actions can be undone) |

Use the **Customize columns** menu to select columns that you'd like to show or hide. 

You can also download the entire list in CSV format using the **Export** feature, specify the number of items to show per page, and navigate between pages.

## View details about an automated investigation

![Image of investigation details window](images/atp-analyze-auto-ir.png)

You can view the details of an automated investigation to see information such as the investigation graph, alerts associated with the investigation, the machine that was investigated, and other information.

In this view, you'll see the name of the investigation, when it started and ended. 

### Investigation graph

The investigation graph provides a graphical representation of an automated investigation. All investigation related information is simplified and arranged in specific sections. Clicking on any of the icons brings you the relevant section where you can view more information.

A progress ring shows two status indicators:
- Orange ring - shows the pending portion of the investigation
- Green ring - shows the running time portion of the investigation

![Image of start, end, and pending time for an automated investigation](images/atp-auto-investigation-pending.png) 

In the example image, the automated investigation started on 10:26:59 AM and ended on 10:56:26 AM. Therefore, the entire investigation was running for 29 minutes and 27 seconds. 

The pending time of 16 minutes and 51 seconds reflects two possible pending states: pending for asset (for example, the device might have disconnected from the network) or pending for approval. 

From this view, you can also view and add comments and tags about the investigation.

### Alerts

The **Alerts** tab for an automated investigation shows details such as a short description of the alert that initiated the automated investigation, severity, category, the machine associated with the alert, user, time in queue, status, investigation state, and who the investigation is assigned to. 

Additional alerts seen on a machine can be added to an automated investigation as long as the investigation is ongoing. 

Selecting an alert using the check box brings up the alerts details pane where you have the option of opening the alert page, manage the alert by changing its status, see alert details, automated investigation details, related machine, logged-on users, and comments and history. 

Clicking on an alert title brings you the alert page.

### Machines

The **Machines** tab Shows details the machine name, IP address, group, users, operating system, remediation level, investigation count, and when it was last investigated.

Machines that show the same threat can be added to an ongoing investigation and will be displayed in this tab. If 10 or more machines are found during this expansion process from the same entity, then that expansion action will require an approval and will be seen in the **Pending actions** view.

Selecting a machine using the checkbox brings up the machine details pane where you can see more information such as machine details and logged-on users.

Clicking on an machine name brings you the machine page.

### Evidence

You'll see the action type, action, status, machine name, description of the action, comments entered by analysts who may have worked on the investigation, execution start time, duration, pending duration.

As with other sections, you can customize columns, select the number of items to show per page, and filter the log.
