title: Remediation
description: You can lower down your organization's exposure from vulnerabilities and increase your security configuration by remediating the security recommendations. Threat & Vulnerability Management bridges the gap between security administration and IT administration during remediation process. It does so by creating a security task or ticket through integration with Microsoft Intune and Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM).

# Remediation
**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

[!include[Prereleaseï¿½information](prerelease.md)]

After your organization's cybersecurity weaknesses are identified and mapped to actionable security recommendations, you can start creating security tasks or ticket through the integration with Microsoft Intune and Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM).

You can lower down your organization's exposure from vulnerabilities and increase your security configuration by remediating the security recommendations.

## Navigate through your remediation options 
You'll see your remediation options when you select one of the security recommendation blocks from your **Top security recommendations** widget in the dashboard. 

1. From the fly-in page, you'll see the security recommendation details including your next steps. Click **Remediation options**.
2. In the **Remediation options** page, select **Open a ticket in Intune (for AAD joined devices)**. 
3. Select a remediation due date.
4. Add notes to give your IT administrator a context of your remediation request. For example, you can indicate urgency of the remediation request to avoid potential exposure to a recent exploit activity, or if the request is a part of compliance. 

## How it works

When you submit a remediation request from Threat & Vulnerability Management, it kicks-off a remediation activity. 

It creates a security task which will be tracked in Threat & Vulnerability Management **Remediation page**, and it also creates a remediation ticket in Microsoft Intune.

You also have the option to export all remediation activity data to CSV for records, reporting purposes, or if you want to notify your IT administration counterpart that a remediation ticket has been submitted. 

The dashboard will show that status of your top remediation activities. Click any of the entries and it will take you to the **Remediation** page. You can mark the remediation activity as completed after the IT administration team remediates the task.
