## Before you begin:

## The schema of the events in the Storage account:

- A blobs container will be created for each event type:

- The schema of each row in a Blob is the following Json: 

```
{
        "time": "<The time WDATP received the event>"
        "tenantId": "<Your tenant ID>"
        "category": "<The Advanced Hunting table name with 'AdvancedHunting-' prefix>"
        "properties": { <WDATP Advanced Hunting event as Json> }
}               
```

- each blob contains multiple rows.
- Each raw contains the event name, the time WDATP received the event, the tenant it belongs ( You will only get events from your tenant ), and the event in JSON format in a property called "properties".
- Check out [Advanced Hunting overview](overview-hunting.md) to learn about the schema of WDATP events.

## Data types mapping:

In order to get the data types for our events properties do the following:

- Login to our portal and go to [Advanced Hunting page](https://securitycenter.windows.com/hunting-package).
- Run the following query to get the data types mapping for each event: 
```

| project ColumnName, ColumnType 

```
