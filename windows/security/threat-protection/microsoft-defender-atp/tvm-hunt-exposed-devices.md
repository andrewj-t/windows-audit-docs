# Hunt for exposed devices - threat and vulnerability management

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

## Use advanced hunting to find devices with vulnerabilities

Advanced hunting is a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you explore up to 30 days of raw data. You can proactively inspect events in your network to locate threat indicators and entities. The flexible access to data enables unconstrained hunting for both known and potential threats. [Learn more about advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md)

### Schema tables

- [DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities](advanced-hunting-devicetvmsoftwareinventoryvulnerabilities-table.md) - Inventory of software on devices as well as any known vulnerabilities in these software products

- [DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilitiesKB](advanced-hunting-devicetvmsoftwarevulnerabilitieskb-table.md) - Knowledge base of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, including whether exploit code is publicly available

- [DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment](advanced-hunting-devicetvmsecureconfigurationassessment-table.md) - Threat & Vulnerability Management assessment events, indicating the status of various security configurations on devices

- [DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB](advanced-hunting-devicetvmsecureconfigurationassessmentkb-table.md) - Knowledge base of various security configurations used by Threat & Vulnerability Management to assess devices; includes mappings to various standards and benchmarks

## Check which devices are involved in high severity alerts

1. Go to **Advanced hunting** from the left-hand navigation pane of the Microsoft Defender Security Center.

2. Scroll down to the TVM advanced hunting schemas to familiarize yourself with the column names.

3. Enter the following queries:

```kusto
// Search for devices with High active alerts or Critical CVE public exploit
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities
| join kind=inner(DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilitiesKB) on CveId
| where IsExploitAvailable == 1 and CvssScore >= 7
| summarize NumOfVulnerabilities=dcount(CveId),
DeviceName=any(DeviceName) by DeviceId
| join kind =inner(DeviceAlertEvents) on DeviceId  
| summarize NumOfVulnerabilities=any(NumOfVulnerabilities),
DeviceName=any(DeviceName) by DeviceId, AlertId
| project DeviceName, NumOfVulnerabilities, AlertId  
| order by NumOfVulnerabilities desc

```
