# Endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

## What is EDR in block mode?

When [endpoint detection and response](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/overview-endpoint-detection-response) (EDR) in block mode is enabled, Microsoft Defender ATP leverages behavioral blocking and containment capabilities by blocking malicious artifacts or behaviors that are observed through post-breach protection. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach. 

> [!NOTE]
> EDR in block mode is currently in private preview. To get the best protection, make sure to **[deploy Microsoft Defender ATP baselines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-machines-security-baseline)**.

## What happens when something is detected?

When EDR in block mode is turned on, and a malicious artifact is detected, blocking and remediation actions are taken. You'll see detection status as **Blocked** or **Remediated** as completed actions in the [Action center](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/respond-machine-alerts#check-activity-details-in-action-center).

The following image shows an instance of unwanted software that was detected and blocked through EDR in block mode:

## Enable EDR in block mode

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the [requirements](#requirements-for-edr-in-block-mode) are met before turning on EDR in block mode.

1. Go to the Microsoft Defender Security Center ([https://securitycenter.windows.com](https://securitycenter.windows.com)) and sign in. 

2. Choose **Settings** > **Advanced features**.

3. Turn on **EDR in block mode**.

> [!NOTE]
> EDR in block mode can be turned on only in the Microsoft Defender Security Center. You cannot use registry keys, Intune, or group policies to enable or disable EDR in block mode.

## Frequently asked questions 

### Will EDR in block mode have any impact on a user's antivirus protection? 

No. EDR in block mode does not affect third-party antivirus protection running on users' devices. EDR in block mode kicks in if the primary antivirus solution misses something, or if there is a post-breach detection. EDR in block mode works just like [Microsoft Defender Antivirus in passive mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility#functionality-and-features-available-in-each-state), with the additional steps of blocking and remediating malicious artifacts or behaviors that are detected. 

### Why do I need to keep Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date? 

Because Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects and remediates malicious items, it's important to keep it up to date to leverage the latest device learning models, behavioral detections, and heuristics for EDR in block mode to be most effective. The [Microsoft Defender ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection) stack of capabilities works in an integrated manner, and to get best protection value, you should keep Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date.  

### Why do we need cloud protection on? 

Cloud protection is needed to turn on the feature on the device. Cloud protection allows [Microsoft Defender ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection) to deliver the latest and greatest protection based on our breadth and depth of security intelligence, along with behavioral and device learning models.
