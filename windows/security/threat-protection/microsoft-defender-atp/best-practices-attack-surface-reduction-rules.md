<!--ASR guidance for deploying rules (links to Antonioâ€™s blog, recommendations for deploying rules to small set of devices first, code signing, link to ASR Power BI template, and link to M365 security center reports) and 8.	Policy conflict (details about what happens with conflicting policies, what happens when settings from different policies are merged)
-->

Whether you're about to enable or have already deployed attack surface reduction rules for your organization, see the information in this article. By using the tips and best practices in this article, you can employ attack surface reduction rules successfully and avoid potential issues.

## Use a phased approach

Before you roll out attack surface reduction rules in your organization, select a small set of managed devices to start. This approach enables you to see how attack surface reduction rules work in your environment and gives you flexibility in applying exclusions. You can do this with dynamic membership rules.

<!--Siddarth, we need to find the info about how to set up dynamic membership rules and add a procedure here.-->

## Use code signing for applications

## Get the Power BI report template
