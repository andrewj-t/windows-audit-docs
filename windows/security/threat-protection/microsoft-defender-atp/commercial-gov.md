# Microsoft Defender ATP in Azure Government 

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) in Azure Government uses the same underlying technologies as Microsoft Defender ATP in Azure Commercial. This offering is currently available to US Office 365 GCC High customers and  is based on the same prevention, detection, investigation, and remediation as the commercial version. However, there are some key differences in the availability of capabilities for Azure Government version. 


## Endpoint versions
The following OS versions are supported:

- Windows 10, version 1903 
- Windows 10, version 1809 (OS Build 17763.404 with [KB4490481](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4490481))
- Windows 10, version 1803 (OS Build 17134.799 with [KB4499183](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4499183))
- Windows 10, version 1709 (OS Build 16299.1182 with [KB4499147](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4499147)) 
- Windows Server, 2019 (with [KB4490481](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4490481))

>[!NOTE]
>If patches are not implemented after the machine onboarding, some Microsoft Defender ATP telemetry might be sent to the Microsoft Defender ATP Commercial Cloud.

The following OS versions are not supported:
- Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016
