## Phased deployment approach
Regardless of the deployment strategy you decide to implement, deploying Microsoft Defender ATP can be done in a phased approach. 

Enterprises can deploy the service on a pilot collection, and then incrementally roll the service out to a larger set of devices.

Adopting a phased approach helps reduce potential issues or conflicts that could arise while rolling the service out.

|**Pilot and deployment phases**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
Pilot and deployment planning | Phase 1: Identify 50 systems for pilot testing - Focus on the security team, IT team and maybe Helpdesk
Full scale pilot | Phase 2: 100  systems <br> 	Phase 3: 150 systems <br> Phase 4: 500 systems <br> Phase 5: 1000 systems <br><br> Review and assess if there required tweaks to deployment. 
Full deployment | Roll out service to the rest of environment in larger increments.
