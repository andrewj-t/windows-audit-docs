## How to install Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac

### Prerequisites

- A Microsoft Defender ATP subscription and access to the Microsoft Defender Security Center portal
- Beginner-level experience in macOS and BASH scripting
- Administrative privileges on the device (in case of manual deployment)

### Installation instructions

There are several methods and deployment tools that you can use to install and configure Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac.

- Third-party management tools:

    - [Microsoft Intune-based deployment](microsoft-defender-atp-mac-install-with-intune.md)
    - [JAMF-based deployment](microsoft-defender-atp-mac-install-with-jamf.md)
    - [Other MDM products](microsoft-defender-atp-mac-install-with-other-mdm.md)

- Command-line tool:
    - [Manual deployment](microsoft-defender-atp-mac-install-manually.md)

### System requirements

The three most recent major releases of macOS are supported:

- 10.15 (Catalina), 10.14 (Mojave), 10.13 (High Sierra)
- Disk space: 650 MB

 Beta versions of macOS are not supported. macOS Sierra (10.12) support will end on January 1, 2020.

### Network connections

After you've enabled the service, you may need to configure your network or firewall to allow outbound connections between it and your endpoints.

The following table lists the services and their associated URLs that your network must be able to connect to. You should ensure that there are no firewall or network filtering rules that would deny access to these URLs, or you may need to create an *allow* rule specifically for them.

| Service location                         | DNS record              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Common URLs for all locations            |  x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> eu-cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> wu-cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> *.blob.core.windows.net <br/> officecdn-microsoft-com.akamaized.net <br/> crl.microsoft.com <br/>  events.data.microsoft.com |
| European Union                           | europe.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> eu-v20.events.data.microsoft.com |
| United Kingdom                           | unitedkingdom.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> uk-v20.events.data.microsoft.com |
| United States                            | unitedstates.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com  <br/> us-v20.events.data.microsoft.com |

Microsoft Defender ATP can discover a proxy server by using the following discovery methods:
- Web Proxy Auto-discovery Protocol (WPAD)
- Manual static proxy configuration

If a proxy or firewall is blocking anonymous traffic, make sure that anonymous traffic is permitted in the previously listed URLs.

To test that a connection is not blocked, open [https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report](https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report) and [https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping](https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping) in a browser.

If you prefer the command line, you can also check the connection by running the following command in Terminal:

```bash
$ curl -w ' %{url_effective}\n' 'https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report' 'https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping'
```

The output from this command should be similar to the following:

> `OK https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report`
>
> `OK https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping`

> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend that you keep [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) (SIP) enabled on client machines. SIP is a built-in macOS security feature that prevents low-level tampering with the OS, and is enabled by default.

Once Microsoft Defender ATP is installed, connectivity can be validated by running the following command in Terminal:
```bash
$ mdatp --connectivity-test
```

## Enable Endpoint Detection and Response preview features

If you are an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) private or public preview customer, you can set up your machine to receive EDR preview features. Currently this flag enables or disables the entire EDR functionality.

### Intune-based EDR preview set up

Create configuration profile com.microsoft.wdav.plist with the following content:
```XML
