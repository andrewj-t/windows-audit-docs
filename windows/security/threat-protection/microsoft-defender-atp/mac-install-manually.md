## Client configuration

1. Copy wdav.pkg and MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.py to the device where you deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for macOS.

    The client device is not associated with orgId. Note that the *orgId* attribute is blank.

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field org_id
    ```

2. Run the Python script to install the configuration file:

    ```bash
    /usr/bin/python MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.py
    ```

3. Verify that the device is now associated with your organization and reports a valid *orgId*:

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field org_id
    ```

After installation, you'll see the Microsoft Defender icon in the macOS status bar in the top-right corner.

## How to Allow Full Disk Access

> [!CAUTION]
> macOS 10.15 (Catalina) contains new security and privacy enhancements. Beginning with this version, by default, applications are not able to access certain locations on disk (such as Documents, Downloads, Desktop, etc.) without explicit consent. In the absence of this consent, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is not able to fully protect your device.

To grant consent, open System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Full Disk Access. Click the lock icon to make changes (bottom of the dialog box). Select Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## Logging installation issues
