# Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for iOS features

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Endpoint for iOS would use a VPN in order to provide the Web Protection feature. This is not a regular VPN and is a local/self-looping VPN that does not take traffic outside the device.

## Configure custom indicators

Defender for Endpoint for iOS enables admins to configure custom indicators on iOS devices as well. Refer to [Manage indicators](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/manage-indicators) on how to configure custom indicators.

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Endpoint for iOS supports creating custom indicators only for IP addresses and URLs/domains.

## Web Protection

By default, Defender for Endpoint for iOS includes and enables the web protection feature. [Web protection](web-protection-overview.md) helps to secure devices against web threats and protect users from phishing attacks.
