With custom detections, you can proactively monitor for and respond to various events and system states, including suspected breach activity and misconfigured devices. You can do this with customizable detection rules that automatically trigger alerts and response actions.

Custom detections work with [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md), which provides a powerful, flexible query language that covers a broad set of event and system information from your network. You can set them to run at regular intervals, generating alerts and taking response actions whenever there are matches.

Custom detections provide:
- Alerts for rule-based detections built from advanced hunting queries
- Automatic response actions that apply to files and devices
