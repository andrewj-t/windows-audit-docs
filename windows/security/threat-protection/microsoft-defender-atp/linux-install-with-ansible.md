# Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux with Ansible

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux](microsoft-defender-atp-linux.md)

This article describes how to deploy Defender for Endpoint for Linux using Ansible. A successful deployment requires the completion of all of the following tasks:

- [Download the onboarding package](#download-the-onboarding-package)
- [Create Ansible YAML files](#create-ansible-yaml-files)
- [Deployment](#deployment)
- [References](#references)

## Prerequisites and system requirements

Before you get started, see [the main Defender for Endpoint for Linux page](microsoft-defender-atp-linux.md) for a description of prerequisites and system requirements for the current software version.

In addition, for Ansible deployment, you need to be familiar with Ansible administration tasks, have Ansible configured, and know how to deploy playbooks and tasks. Ansible has many ways to complete the same task. These instructions assume availability of supported Ansible modules, such as *apt* and *unarchive* to help deploy the package. Your organization might use a different workflow. Refer to the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/) for details.

- Ansible needs to be installed on at least one computer (we will call it the primary computer).
- SSH must be configured for an administrator account between the primary computer and all clients, and it is recommended be configured with public key authentication.
- The following software must be installed on all clients:
  - curl
  - python-apt

- All hosts must be listed in the following format in the `/etc/ansible/hosts` or relevant file:

    ```bash
    [servers]
    host1 ansible_ssh_host=10.171.134.39
    host2 ansible_ssh_host=51.143.50.51
    ```

- Ping test:

    ```bash
    ansible -m ping all
    ```

## Download the onboarding package

Download the onboarding package from Microsoft Defender Security Center:

1. In Microsoft Defender Security Center, go to **Settings > Device Management > Onboarding**.
2. In the first drop-down menu, select **Linux Server** as the operating system. In the second drop-down menu, select **Your preferred Linux configuration management tool** as the deployment method.
3. Select **Download onboarding package**. Save the file as WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip.

4. From a command prompt, verify that you have the file. Extract the contents of the archive:

    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
    ```Output
    total 8
    -rw-r--r-- 1 test  staff  4984 Feb 18 11:22 WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    ```
    ```bash
    unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    ```
    ```Output
    Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    inflating: mdatp_onboard.json
    ```

## Create Ansible YAML files

Create a subtask or role files that contribute to an playbook or task.

- Create the onboarding task, `onboarding_setup.yml`:

    ```bash
    - name: Create MDATP directories
      file:
        path: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/
        recurse: true
        state: directory
        mode: 0755
        owner: root
        group: root

    - name: Register mdatp_onboard.json
      stat:
        path: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/mdatp_onboard.json
      register: mdatp_onboard

    - name: Extract WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip into /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp
      unarchive:
        src: WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
        dest: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp
        mode: 0600
        owner: root
        group: root
      when: not mdatp_onboard.stat.exists
    ```

- Add the Defender for Endpoint repository and key.

    Defender for Endpoint for Linux can be deployed from one of the following channels (denoted below as *[channel]*): *insiders-fast*, *insiders-slow*, or *prod*. Each of these channels corresponds to a Linux software repository.

    The choice of the channel determines the type and frequency of updates that are offered to your device. Devices in *insiders-fast* are the first ones to receive updates and new features, followed later by *insiders-slow* and lastly by *prod*.

    In order to preview new features and provide early feedback, it is recommended that you configure some devices in your enterprise to use either *insiders-fast* or *insiders-slow*.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Switching the channel after the initial installation requires the product to be reinstalled. To switch the product channel: uninstall the existing package, re-configure your device to use the new channel, and follow the steps in this document to install the package from the new location.

    Note your distribution and version and identify the closest entry for it under `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/`.

    In the following commands, replace *[distro]* and *[version]* with the information you've identified.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In case of Oracle Linux, replace *[distro]* with “rhel”.

  ```bash
  - name: Add Microsoft APT key
      apt_key:
          keyserver: https://packages.microsoft.com/
          id: BC528686B50D79E339D3721CEB3E94ADBE1229CF
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

  - name: Add Microsoft apt repository for MDATP
      apt_repository:
          repo: deb [arch=arm64,armhf,amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/[distro]/[version]/prod [channel] main
          update_cache: yes
          state: present
          filename: microsoft-[channel].list
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

  - name: Add  Microsoft yum repository for MDATP
      yum_repository:
          name: packages-microsoft-com-prod-[channel]
          description: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
          file: microsoft-[channel]
          baseurl: https://packages.microsoft.com/[distro]/[version]/[channel]/
          gpgcheck: yes
          enabled: Yes
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
  ```

- Create the Ansible install and uninstall YAML files.

    - For apt-based distributions use the following YAML file:

        ```bash
        cat install_mdatp.yml
        ```
        ```Output
        - hosts: servers
            tasks:
                - include: ../roles/onboarding_setup.yml
                - include: ../roles/add_apt_repo.yml
                - apt:
                    name: mdatp
                    state: latest
                    update_cache: yes
        ```

        ```bash
        cat uninstall_mdatp.yml
        ```
        ```Output
        - hosts: servers
        tasks:
            - apt:
                name: mdatp
                state: absent
        ```

    - For yum-based distributions use the following YAML file:

        ```bash
        cat install_mdatp_yum.yml
        ```
        ```Output
        - hosts: servers
        tasks:
            - include: ../roles/onboarding_setup.yml
            - include: ../roles/add_yum_repo.yml
            - yum:
                name: mdatp
                state: latest
                enablerepo: packages-microsoft-com-prod-[channel]
        ```

        ```bash
        cat uninstall_mdatp_yum.yml
        ```
        ```Output
        - hosts: servers
        tasks:
            - yum:
                name: mdatp
                state: absent
        ```

## Deployment

Now run the tasks files under `/etc/ansible/playbooks/` or relevant directory.

- Installation:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/playbooks/install_mdatp.yml -i /etc/ansible/hosts
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When the product starts for the first time, it downloads the latest antimalware definitions. Depending on your Internet connection, this can take up to a few minutes.

- Validation/configuration:

    ```bash
    ansible -m shell -a 'mdatp connectivity test' all
    ```
    ```bash
    ansible -m shell -a 'mdatp health' all
    ```

- Uninstallation:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/playbooks/uninstall_mdatp.yml -i /etc/ansible/hosts
    ```

## Testing

Run a detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on a newly onboarded device:

- Ensure that real-time protection is enabled (denoted by a result of `1` from running the following command):

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
    ```

- Open a Terminal window. Copy and execute the following command:

    ``` bash
    curl -o ~/Downloads/eicar.com.txt https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt
    ```

- The file should have been quarantined by Defender for Endpoint for Linux. Use the following command to list all the detected threats:

    ```bash
    mdatp threat list
    ```

If the the test file isn't detected and quarantined, it might be labeled as an allowed threat. See the [allowedThreats](linux-preferences.md#allowed-threats) option and the structure of the configuration profile at [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux](linux-preferences.md).

## Log installation issues

See [Log installation issues](linux-resources.md#log-installation-issues) for more information on how to find the automatically generated log that is created by the installer when an error occurs.

## Operating system upgrades

When upgrading your operating system to a new major version, you must first uninstall Defender for Endpoint for Linux, install the upgrade, and finally reconfigure Defender for Endpoint for Linux on your device.
