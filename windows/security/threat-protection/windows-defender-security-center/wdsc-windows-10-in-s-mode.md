# Manage Windows Defender Security Center in Windows 10 in S mode

**Applies to**

- Windows 10 in S mode, version 1803

**Audience**

	• Enterprise security administrators

**Manageability available with**

	• Microsoft Intune

Windows 10 in S mode is streamlined for tighter security and superior performance. With Windows 10 in S mode, users can only use apps from the Microsoft Store, ensuring Microsoft-verified security so you can minimize malware attacks. In addition, using Microsoft Edge provides a more secure browser experience, with extra protections against phishing and malicious software.

The Windows Defender Security Center interface is a little different in Windows 10 in S mode. The **Virus & threat protection** area has fewer options, because the built-in security of Windows 10 in S mode prevents viruses and other threats from running on devices in your organization. In addition, devices running Windows 10 in S mode receive security updates automatically.

##Managing Windows Defender Security Center settings with Intune

In the enterprise, you can only manage security settings for devices running Windows 10 in S mode with Microsoft Intune or other mobile device management apps. Windows 10 in S mode prevents making changes via PowerShell scripts. For information about using Intune to manage Windows Defender Security Center settings on your organization's devices, see Set up Intune and Endpoint protection settings for Windows 10 (and later) in Intune.
