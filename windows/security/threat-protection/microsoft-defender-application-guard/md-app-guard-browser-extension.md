# Microsoft Defender Application Guard Extension

This article applies to:

- Windows 10

Microsoft Defender Application Guard Extension is a web browser extension that protects your device from advanced attacks, by redirecting untrusted websites to an isolated version of the [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) browser. If an untrusted website turns out to be malicious, it remains within Application Guard's secure container, keeping your device protected.

## Supported browsers

The Microsoft Defender Application Guard Extension is available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/application-guard-extensi/mfjnknhkkiafjajicegabkbimfhplplj/) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/application-guard-extension/). It can be installed individually by the user, or deployed across the enterprise by an administrator.

> [!TIP]
> This extension broadens Microsoft Defender Application Guard support to browsers *other* than Microsoft Edge. 
>
> It is not necessary to install any extension on Edge to access Application Guard's protective features, since Application Guard offers [native support](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-windows-defender-application-guard) to that browser.

## Prerequisites

Microsoft Defender Application Guard Extension works with the following editions of Windows 10, version 1803 or later:

- Windows 10 Professional
- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Windows 10 Education

Application Guard Extension also requires that the [Application Guard companion app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/windows-defender-application-guard-companion/9n8gnlc8z9c8?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) be installed locally. The app enables Application Guard to work with web browsers other than Microsoft Edge.

## Known issues

Issue | Mitigation
-|-
Extensions cannot automatically turn on for incognito mode (off by default) | Disable Incognito via policy, by setting **IncognitoModeAvailablity** to **1**
Extensions can be turned off | Use ExtensionSettings policy by setting **Installation_mode** to **force_installed**.
Chrome does not offer url to extensions on cold start | Donâ€™t let users disable background process via policy, by setting **backgroundModeEnabled** to **1**.
If the user's network roams or the network isolation policy changes, an untrusted page may load | If a page attempts to load but is no longer trusted, Application Guard will try to redirect the page and invalidate the cache. However, this issue is only partially mitigated on the backend and leaves browsers open to drive-by attacks under certain circumstances.
