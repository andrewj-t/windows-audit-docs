# Windows Defender Application Control Wizard

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016 and above

> [!NOTE]
> Some capabilities of Windows Defender Application Control are only available on specific Windows versions. Learn more about the [Windows Defender Application Control feature availability](feature-availability.md).

The Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy wizard is an open-source Windows desktop application written in C# and bundled as an MSIX package. The wizard was built to provide security architects with security, and system administrators with a more user-friendly means to create, edit, and merge WDAC policies. The wizard desktop application uses the [ConfigCI PowerShell Cmdlets](/powershell/module/configci) in the backend so the output policy of the wizard and PowerShell cmdlets is identical.

## Downloading the application

The WDAC wizard can be downloaded from the official [WDAC Wizard installer website](https://webapp-wdac-wizard.azurewebsites.net) as an MSIX packaged application. The wizard's source code is available as part of Microsoft's Open Source Software offerings on GitHub at the [WDAC Wizard Repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WDAC-Toolkit).

**Supported Clients**

As the WDAC wizard uses the cmdlets in the background, the wizard is functional on clients only where the cmdlets are supported as outlined in [WDAC feature availability](feature-availability.md). Specifically, the tool will verify that the client meets one of the following requirements: 

-   WindowsÂ builds 1909+
-   For pre-1909 builds, the Enterprise SKU of Windows is installed

If neither requirement is satisfied, the wizard will throw an error as the cmdlets are not available.
