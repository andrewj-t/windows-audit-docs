# Configure and validate Windows Defender Antivirus network connections

**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

To ensure Windows Defender Antivirus cloud-delivered protection works properly, you need to configure your network to allow connections between your endpoints and certain Microsoft servers.

This topic lists the connections that must be allowed, such as by using firewall rules, and provides instructions for validating your connection. This will help ensure you receive the best protection from our cloud-delivered protection services.

See the Enterprise Mobility and Security blog post [Important changes to Microsoft Active Protection Services endpoint](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2016/05/31/important-changes-to-microsoft-active-protection-service-maps-endpoint/) for some details about network connectivity.

>[!TIP]
>You can also visit the Windows Defender ATP demo website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the following features are working:
>
>- Cloud-delivered protection
>- Fast learning (including block at first sight)
>- Potentially unwanted application blocking

## Allow connections to the Windows Defender Antivirus cloud service

The Windows Defender Antivirus cloud service provides fast, strong protection for your endpoints. Enabling the cloud-delivered protection service is optional, however it is highly recommended because it provides very important protection against malware on your endpoints and across your network.

>[!NOTE]
>The Windows Defender Antivirus cloud service is a mechanism for delivering updated protection to your network and endpoints. Although it is called a cloud service, it is not simply protection for files stored in the cloud, rather it uses distributed resources and machine learning to deliver protection to your endpoints at a rate that is far faster than traditional Security intelligence updates.

See [Enable cloud-delivered protection](enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) for details on enabling the service with Intune, System Center Configuration Manager, Group Policy, PowerShell cmdlets, or on individual clients in the Windows Security app.

After you've enabled the service, you may need to configure your network or firewall to allow connections between it and your endpoints.

The following table lists the services and their associated URLs that your network must be able to connect to. You should ensure there are no firewall or network filtering rules that would deny access to these URLs, or you may need to create an **allow** rule specifically for them:

## Validate connections between your network and the cloud

After whitelisting the URLs listed above, you can test if you are connected to the Windows Defender Antivirus cloud service and are correctly reporting and receiving information to ensure you are fully protected.

**Use the cmdline tool to validate cloud-delivered protection:**

Use the following argument with the Windows Defender Antivirus command line utility (*mpcmdrun.exe*) to verify that your network can communicate with the Windows Defender Antivirus cloud service:

```DOS
MpCmdRun -ValidateMapsConnection
```

> [!NOTE]
> You need to open an administrator-level version of the command prompt. Right-click the item in the Start menu, click **Run as administrator** and click **Yes** at the permissions prompt. This command will only work on Windows 10, version 1703 or higher.

See [Manage Windows Defender Antivirus with the mpcmdrun.exe commandline tool](command-line-arguments-windows-defender-antivirus.md) for more information on how to use the *mpcmdrun.exe* utility.

**Attempt to download a fake malware file from Microsoft:**

You can download a sample file that Windows Defender Antivirus will detect and block if you are properly connected to the cloud.

Download the file by visiting the following link:
- http://aka.ms/ioavtest

>[!NOTE]
>This file is not an actual piece of malware. It is a fake file that is designed to test if you are properly connected to the cloud.

If you are properly connected, you will see a warning Windows Defender Antivirus notification:

![Windows Defender Antivirus notification informing the user that malware was found](images/defender/wdav-malware-detected.png)

If you are using Microsoft Edge, you'll also see a notification message:

![Microsoft Edge informing the user that malware was found](images/defender/wdav-bafs-edge.png)

A similar message occurs if you are using Internet Explorer:

![Windows Defender Antivirus notification informing the user that malware was found](images/defender/wdav-bafs-ie.png)

You will also see a detection under **Quarantined threats** in the **Scan history** section in the Windows Security app:

1. Open the Windows Security app by clicking the shield icon in the task bar or searching the start menu for **Defender**.

2. Click the **Virus & threat protection** tile (or the shield icon on the left menu bar) and then the **Scan history** label:

    ![Screenshot of the Scan history label in the Windows Security app](images/defender/wdav-history-wdsc.png)

3. Under the **Quarantined threats** section, click the **See full history** label to see the detected fake malware:

>[!NOTE]
>Versions of Windows 10 before version 1703 have a different user interface. See [Windows Defender Antivirus in the Windows Security app](windows-defender-security-center-antivirus.md) for more information about the differences between versions, and instructions on how to perform common tasks in the different interfaces.

The Windows event log will also show [Windows Defender client event ID 2050](troubleshoot-windows-defender-antivirus.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You will not be able to use a proxy auto-config (.pac) file to test network connections to these URLs. You will need to verify your proxy servers and any network filtering tools manually to ensure connectivity.
