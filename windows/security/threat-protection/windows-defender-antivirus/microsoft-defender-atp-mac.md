# Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

This topic describes how to install and use Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac. It supports the preview program and the information here is subject to change. 
Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac is not yet widely available, and this topic only applies to enterprise customers who have been accepted into the preview program. 

## Whatâ€™s new in the public preview

- Fully accessible
- Various bug fixes
- Improved performance
- Improved user experience

- Reduced delay for Mac devices to appear in the ATP console, following deployment.
- Admins can set their cloud preference for any location, not just those in the US.


## Prerequisites
You should have beginner-level experience in macOS and BASH scripting. You must have administrative privileges on the machine.

You should also have access to Windows Defender Security Center.

### System Requirements
Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac system requirements:
- macOS version: 10.14 (Mojave), 10.13 (High Sierra), 10.12 (Sierra)
- Disk space during preview: 1GB 

After you've enabled the service, you may need to configure your network or firewall to allow outbound connections between it and your endpoints.

The following table lists the services and their associated URLs that your network must be able to connect to. You should ensure there are no firewall or network filtering rules that would deny access to these URLs, or you may need to create an **allow** rule specifically for them:

| Service        | Description                          | URL                                                                  |
| -------------- |:------------------------------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| ATP            | Advanced threat protection service   | `https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/`, `https://*.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/` |

To test that a connection is not blocked, open `https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report` and `https://wu-cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/` in a browser, or run the following command in Terminal:

```
    mavel-mojave:~ testuser$ curl 'https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report'
    OK
```

We recommend to keep [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection)) enabled (default setting) on client machines. 
SIP is a built-in macOS security feature that prevents low-level tampering with the OS.

5.  You should also see the Microsoft Defender icon in the top-right corner:

    ![Microsoft Defender icon in status bar screenshot](images/MDATP_Icon_Bar.png)

## JAMF based deployment
### Prerequsites
You need to be familiar with JAMF administration tasks, have a JAMF tenant, and know how to deploy packages. This includes a properly configured distribution point. JAMF has many alternative ways to complete the same task. These instructions provide you an example for most common processes. Your organization might use a different workflow. 


### Download installation and onboarding packages
Download the installation and onboarding packages from Windows Defender Security Center:
1.  In Windows Defender Security Center, go to **Settings > Machine Management > Onboarding**.
2.  In Section 1 of the page, set operating system to **Linux, macOS, iOS or Android** and Deployment method to **Mobile Device Management / Microsoft Intune**.
3.  In Section 2 of the page, select **Download installation package**. Save it as wdav.pkg to a local directory.
4.  In Section 2 of the page, select **Download onboarding package**. Save it as WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip to the same directory.

    ![Windows Defender Security Center screenshot](images/MDATP_2_IntuneAppUtil.png)

5. From a command prompt, verify that you have the two files. 
    Extract the contents of the .zip files:
    
    ```
    mavel-macmini:Downloads test$ ls -l
    total 721160
    -rw-r--r--  1 test  staff      11821 Mar 15 09:23 WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    -rw-r--r--  1 test  staff  354531845 Mar 13 08:57 wdav.pkg
    mavel-macmini:Downloads test$ unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
    warning:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip appears to use backslashes as path separators

     inflating: intune/WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.xml
     inflating: jamf/WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.plist
    mavel-macmini:Downloads test$
    ``` 

### Create JAMF Policies
You need to create a configuration profile and a policy to start deploying Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac to client machines.

#### Configuration Profile
The configuration profile contains one custom settings payload that includes:

- Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac onboarding information 
- Approved Kernel Extensions payload to enable the Microsoft kernel driver to run


1. Upload jamf/WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.plist as the Property List File.

    >[!NOTE]
    > You must use exactly "com.microsoft.wdav.atp" as the Preference Domain.

    ![Configuration profile screenshot](images/MDATP_16_PreferenceDomain.png)

#### Approved Kernel Extension

To approve the kernel extension:
1.  In **Computers > Configuration Profiles** select **Options > Approved Kernel Extensions**.
2.  Use **UBF8T346G9** for Team Id.

![Approved kernel extensions screenshot](images/MDATP_17_approvedKernelExtensions.png)

#### Configuration Profile's Scope 
Configure the appropriate scope to specify the machines that will receive this configuration profile.

Open Computers -> Configuration Profiles, select **Scope > Targets**. Select the appropriate Target computers. 

![Configuration profile scope screenshot](images/MDATP_18_ConfigurationProfilesScope.png)

Save the **Configuration Profile**.

Use the **Logs** tab to monitor deployment status for each enrolled machine.

#### Package
1. Create a package in **Settings > Computer Management > Packages**.

    ![Computer management packages screenshot](images/MDATP_19_MicrosoftDefenderWDAVPKG.png)

2. Upload wdav.pkg to the Distribution Point. 
3. In the **filename** field, enter the name of the package. For example, wdav.pkg.

#### Policy
Your policy should contain a single package for Microsoft Defender.

![Microsoft Defender packages screenshot](images/MDATP_20_MicrosoftDefenderPackages.png)

Configure the appropriate scope to specify the computers that will receive this policy.

After you save the Configuration Profile, you can use the Logs tab to monitor the deployment status for each enrolled machine.

### Client machine setup
You need no special provisioning for a macOS computer beyond the standard JAMF Enrollment.

> [!NOTE]
>  After a computer is enrolled, it will show up in the Computers inventory (All Computers). 

1.  Open the machine details, from **General** tab, and make sure that **User Approved MDM** is set to **Yes**. If it's set to No, the user needs to open **System Preferences > Profiles** and select **Approve** on the MDM Profile.

![MDM approve button screenshot](images/MDATP_21_MDMProfile1.png)
![MDM screenshot](images/MDATP_22_MDMProfileApproved.png)

After some time, the machine's User Approved MDM status will change to Yes. 

![MDM status screenshot](images/MDATP_23_MDMStatus.png)

You can enroll additional machines now. Optionally, can do it after system configuration and application packages are provisioned.

### Deployment
Enrolled client machines periodically poll the JAMF Server and install new configuration profiles and policies as soon as they are detected.

#### Status on server
You can monitor the deployment status in the Logs tab:
 - **Pending** means that the deployment is scheduled but has not yet happened 
 - **Completed** means that the deployment succeeded and is no longer scheduled

![Status on server screenshot](images/MDATP_24_StatusOnServer.png)


#### Status on client machine
After the Configuration Profile is deployed, you'll see the profile on the machine in the **System Preferences > Profiles >** Name of Configuration Profile.

![Status on client screenshot](images/MDATP_25_StatusOnClient.png)

After the policy is applied, you'll see the Microsoft Defender icon in the macOS status bar in the top-right corner.

![Microsoft Defender icon in status bar screenshot](images/MDATP_Icon_Bar.png)

You can monitor policy installation on a machine by following the JAMF's log file:

```
mavel-mojave:~ testuser$ tail -f /var/log/jamf.log
Thu Feb 21 11:11:41 mavel-mojave jamf[7960]: No patch policies were found.
Thu Feb 21 11:16:41 mavel-mojave jamf[8051]: Checking for policies triggered by "recurring check-in" for user "testuser"...
Thu Feb 21 11:16:43 mavel-mojave jamf[8051]: Executing Policy WDAV
Thu Feb 21 11:17:02 mavel-mojave jamf[8051]: Installing Microsoft Defender...
Thu Feb 21 11:17:23 mavel-mojave jamf[8051]: Successfully installed Microsoft Defender.
Thu Feb 21 11:17:23 mavel-mojave jamf[8051]: Checking for patches...
Thu Feb 21 11:17:23 mavel-mojave jamf[8051]: No patch policies were found.
```

You can also check the onboarding status:
```
mavel-mojave:~ testuser$ sudo /Library/Extensions/wdavkext.kext/Contents/Resources/Tools/wdavconfig.py
uuid            : 69EDB575-22E1-53E1-83B8-2E1AB1E410A6
orgid           : 79109c9d-83bb-4f3e-9152-8d75ee59ae22
orgid managed   : 79109c9d-83bb-4f3e-9152-8d75ee59ae22
orgid effective : 79109c9d-83bb-4f3e-9152-8d75ee59ae22
```

- **orgid/orgid managed**: This is the Microsoft Defender ATP org id specified in the configuration profile. If this value is blank, then the Configuration Profile was not properly set.

- **orgid effective**: This is the Microsoft Defender ATP org id currently in use. If it does not match the value in the Configuration Profile, then the configuration has not been refreshed.

### Uninstalling Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac
#### Uninstalling with a script

Create a script in **Settings > Computer Management > Scripts**.

![Microsoft Defender uninstall screenshot](images/MDATP_26_Uninstall.png)

For example, this script removes Microsoft Defender ATP from the /Applications directory:

```
echo "Is WDAV installed?"
ls -ld '/Applications/Microsoft Defender ATP.app' 2>/dev/null

echo "Uninstalling WDAV..."
rm -rf '/Applications/Microsoft Defender ATP.app'

echo "Is WDAV still installed?"
ls -ld '/Applications/Microsoft Defender ATP.app' 2>/dev/null

echo "Done!"
```

#### Uninstalling with a policy
Your policy should contain a single script:

![Microsoft Defender uninstall script screenshot](images/MDATP_27_UninstallScript.png)

Configure the appropriate scope in the **Scope** tab to specify the machines that will receive this policy.

### Check onboarding status

You can check that machines are correctly onboarded by creating a script. For example, the following script checks that enrolled machines are onboarded:

```
sudo /Library/Extensions/wdavkext.kext/Contents/Resources/Tools/wdavconfig.py | grep -E 'orgid effective : [-a-zA-Z0-9]+'
```

This script returns 0 if Microsoft Defender ATP is registered with the Windows Defender ATP service, and another exit code if it is not installed or registered.

## Collecting diagnostic information
If you can reproduce a problem, please increase the logging level, run the system for some time, and restore the logging level to the default.

1) Increase logging level:
```
    mavel-mojave:~ testuser$ mdatp log-level --verbose
    Creating connection to daemon
    Connection established
    Operation succeeded
```

2) Reproduce the problem

3) Run `mdatp --diagnostic` to backup Defender ATP's logs. The command will print out location with generated zip file.

    ```
    mavel-mojave:~ testuser$ mdatp --diagnostic
    Creating connection to daemon
    Connection established
    "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Defender/wdavdiag/d85e7032-adf8-434a-95aa-ad1d450b9a2f.zip"
    ```    
   
4) Restore logging level:
```
    mavel-mojave:~ testuser$ mdatp log-level --info
    Creating connection to daemon
    Connection established
    Operation succeeded
```
