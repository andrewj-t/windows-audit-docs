## How to install Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac

### Prerequisites

- You must have a Microsoft Defender ATP subscription.
- You must have access to the Microsoft Defender Security Center portal.
- You should have beginner-level experience in macOS and BASH scripting. 
- If doing a manual deployment, you must have administrative privileges on the device.

### System requirements

> [!CAUTION]
> The three most recent released versions of macOS are supported. Beta versions of macOS are not supported.

- Supported macOS versions: 10.14 (Mojave), 10.13 (High Sierra), 10.12 (Sierra)
- Disk space: 650MB

After you've enabled the service, you may need to configure your network or firewall to allow outbound connections between it and your endpoints.

The following table lists the services and their associated URLs that your network must be able to connect to. You should ensure there are no firewall or network filtering rules that would deny access to these URLs, or you may need to create an *allow* rule specifically for them:

| Service        | Description                          | URL                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ATP            | Advanced threat protection service   | [https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com](https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com), [https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com](https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com) |

To test that a connection is not blocked, open [https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report](https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report) and [https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping]([https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping) in a browser.

If you prefer the command line, you can also check the connection by running the following command in Terminal:

```bash
curl -w ' %{url_effective}\n' 'https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report' 'https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping'
```

The output from this command should look like this:

> `OK https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report`
>
> `OK https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping`

> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend that you keep [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) (SIP) enabled on client machines. SIP is a built-in macOS security feature that prevents low-level tampering with the OS, and is enabled by default.
