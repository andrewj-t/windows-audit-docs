# Deploy and enable antivirus

Depending on the management tool you are using, you may need to specifically enable or configure antivirus protection.

See the table in [Deploy, manage, and report on antivirus](deploy-manage-report-windows-defender-antivirus.md#ref2) for instructions on how to enable protection with Microsoft Intune, System Center Configuration Manager, Group Policy, Active Directory, Microsoft Azure, PowerShell cmdlets, and Windows Management Instruction (WMI).

Some scenarios require additional guidance on how to successfully deploy or configure antivirus protection, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments.

The remaining topic in this section provides end-to-end advice and best practices for [setting up antivirus on virtual machines (VMs) in a VDI or Remote Desktop Services (RDS) environment](deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus.md).
