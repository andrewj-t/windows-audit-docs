# Office 365 together with Windows Defender Antivirus

**Applies to:**

- Windows Defender Antivirus

## Windows Defender Antivirus together with Office 365

You might already know that:

- **Windows Defender Antivirus protects your Windows 10 device from software threats, such as viruses, malware, and spyware**. Windows Defender Antivirus is your complete, ongoing protection, built into Windows 10 and ready to go. 

- **Office 365 includes antiphishing, antispam, and antimalware protection**. With your Office 365 subscription, you get premium email and calendars, Office apps, 1 TB of cloud storage (via OneDrive), and advanced security across all your devices. This is true for home and business users. And if you're a business user, and your organization is using Office 365 E5, you get even more protection through Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection.

- **OneDrive, included in Office 365, enables you to store your files and folders online, and share them as you see fit**. You can work together with people (for work or fun), and coauthor files that are stored in OneDrive. You can also access your files across all your devices (your PC, phone, and tablet).

**But did you know there's at least one very good security reason to use OneDrive together with Windows Defender Antivirus**? It's ransomware protection!

When you save your files to OneDrive, and Windows Defender Antivirus detects a ransomware threat on your device, the following things occur:

1. Windows Defender notifies you of the threat. (If your organization is using Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, your security operations team is notified, too.)

2. Windows Defender Antivirus helps you (and your organization's security team) remove the ransomware from your device.

3. You get the option to use the OneDrive Files Restore feature. This enables you to recover your files in OneDrive to the state they were in before the ransomware attack occurred.

Think of the time and hassle this can save!

## More good reasons to use OneDrive

Protection from ransomware is one great reason to put your files in OneDrive. There are more! Take a look at the following video: <br/><br/>
