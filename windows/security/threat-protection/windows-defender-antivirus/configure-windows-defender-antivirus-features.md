# Configure antivirus features

You can configure antivirus with a number of tools, including:

- Microsoft Intune
- System Center Configuration Manager
- Group Policy
- PowerShell cmdlets
- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

The following broad categories of features can be configured:

- Cloud-delivered protection
- Always-on real-time protection, including behavioral, heuristic, and machine-learning-based protection
- How end-users interact with the client on individual endpoints

The topics in this section describe how to perform key tasks when configuring antivirus. Each topic includes instructions for the applicable configuration tool (or tools).

You can also review the [Reference topics for management and configuration tools](configuration-management-reference-windows-defender-antivirus.md) topic for an overview of each tool and links to further help.
