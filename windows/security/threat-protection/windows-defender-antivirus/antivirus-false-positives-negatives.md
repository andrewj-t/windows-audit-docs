# Handling false positives/negatives in Windows Defender Antivirus

**Applies to:**

Windows Defender Antivirus is designed to keep your PC safe with built-in, trusted antivirus protection. With Windows Defender Antivirus, you get comprehensive, ongoing, and real-time protection against software threats like viruses, malware and spyware across email, apps, the cloud and the web.
