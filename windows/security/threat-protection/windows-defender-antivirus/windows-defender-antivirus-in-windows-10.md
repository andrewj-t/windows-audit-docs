# Windows Defender Antivirus in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016

**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Windows Defender Antivirus is a built-in antimalware solution that provides next generation protection for desktops, portable computers, and servers.

Windows Defender Antivirus includes:
- [Cloud-delivered protection](utilize-microsoft-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) for near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats. Along with machine learning and the Intelligent Security Graph, cloud-delivered protection is part of the next-gen technologies that power Windows Defender Antivirus. 
- [Always-on scanning](configure-real-time-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md), using advanced file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (also known as "real-time protection")
- [Dedicated protection updates](manage-updates-baselines-windows-defender-antivirus.md) based on machine-learning, human and automated big-data analysis, and in-depth threat resistance research

You can configure and manage Windows Defender Antivirus with:
- System Center Configuration Manager (as System Center Endpoint Protection, or SCEP) 
- Microsoft Intune
- PowerShell
- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
- Group Policy

>[!TIP]
>You can visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the following features are working and see how they work:
>- Cloud-delivered protection
>- Fast learning (including Block at first sight)
>- Potentially unwanted application blocking

## What's new in Windows 10, version 1803

- The [block at first sight feature](configure-block-at-first-sight-windows-defender-antivirus.md) can now block non-portable executable files (such as JS, VBS, or macros) as well as executable files.
- The [Virus & threat protection area in the Windows Security app](windows-defender-security-center-antivirus.md) now includes a section for ransomware protection. It includes controlled folder access settings and ransomware recovery settings.


## What's new in Windows 10, version 1703
