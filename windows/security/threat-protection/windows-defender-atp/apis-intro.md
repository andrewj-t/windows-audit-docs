# Windows Defender ATP API overview

**Applies to:**
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

Windows Defender ATP exposes much of its data and actions through a set of programmatic APIs. Those APIs will enable you to automate workflows and innovate based on Windows Defender ATP capabilities. The API access requires OAuth2.0 authentication. For more information, see [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-code).

In general, youâ€™ll need to take the following steps to use the APIs:
- Create an AAD application
- Get an access token using this application
- Use the token to access Windows Defender ATP API


You can access Windows Defender ATP API with **Application Context** or **User Context**.

- **Application Context: (Recommended)** <br>
    Used by apps that run without a signed-in user present. for example, apps that run as background services or daemons.

	Steps that needs to be taken to access Windows Defender ATP API with application context:
	1) Create AAD Web-Application.
	2) Assign the desired permission to the application, e.g 'Read Alerts', 'Isolate Machines' etc. 
	3) Create a key for this Application.
	4) Get token using the application with its key.
	5) Use the token to access Windows Defender ATP API

	See - [Get access with application context](exposed-apis-create-app-webapp.md).


- **User Context:** <br>
    Used to perform actions in the API on behalf of a user.

	Steps that needs to be taken to access Windows Defender ATP API with application context:
	1) Create AAD Native-Application.
	2) Assign the desired permission to the application, e.g 'Read Alerts', 'Isolate Machines' etc. 
	3) Get token using the application with user credentials.
	4) Use the token to access Windows Defender ATP API

	See - [Get access with user context](exposed-apis-create-app-nativeapp.md).
