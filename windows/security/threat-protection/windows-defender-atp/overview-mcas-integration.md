Microsoft Cloud App Security (Cloud App Security) is a comprehensive solution that helps you keep control of assets through improved visibility over cloud apps that are being used across an organization. Cloud Discovery analyzes network traffic data to provide you with ongoing visibility into cloud use, Shadow IT, and the risk Shadow IT poses into your organization.

Windows Defender ATP provides one-click integration with Cloud Discovery by forwarding network connection data gathered from onboarded machines and users. These signals are sent to Cloud App Security, giving administrators deeper visibility into cloud usage, including the use of unsanctioned cloud services.  

By leveraging the Windows Defender ATP endpoint network sensor signals, this integration further enhances Cloud App Security visibility into  machine related activity and expanding coverage of off-network traffic.
