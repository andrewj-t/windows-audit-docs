Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) is a security service that enables enterprise customers to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats on their networks.

Get a quick, but in-depth overview of Windows Defender ATP for Windows 10 and the new capabilities in Windows 10, version 1703 see [Windows Defender ATP for Windows 10 Creators Update](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/mt782787).

Windows Defender ATP uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:

-   **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors
    collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system
    (for example, process, registry, file, and network communications)
    and sends this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Windows Defender ATP.


-   **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, and
    unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem (such as the
    [Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx),
    enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets
    (such as Bing and SmartScreen URL reputation), behavioral signals
    are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses
    to advanced threats.

-   **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams,
    and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat
    intelligence enables Windows Defender ATP to identify attacker
    tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these
    are observed in collected sensor data.

Endpoint investigation capabilities in this service let you drill down
into security alerts and understand the scope and nature of a potential
breach. You can submit files for deep analysis and receive the results
without leaving the [Windows Defender ATP portal](https://securitycenter.windows.com).

Windows Defender ATP works with existing Windows security technologies
on endpoints, such as Windows Defender Antivirus, AppLocker, and Windows Defender Device Guard. It
can also work side-by-side with third-party security solutions and
antimalware products.

Windows Defender ATP leverages Microsoft technology and expertise to
detect sophisticated cyber-attacks, providing:

- Behavior-based, cloud-powered, advanced attack detection

    Finds the attacks that made it past all other defenses (post breach detection), provides actionable, correlated alerts for known and unknown adversaries trying to hide their activities on endpoints.

- Rich timeline for forensic investigation and mitigation

    Easily investigate the scope of breach or suspected behaviours on any machine through a rich machine timeline. File, URLs, and network connection inventory across the network. Gain additional insight using deep collection and analysis (“detonation”) for any file or URLs.

- Built in unique threat intelligence knowledge base

    Unparalleled threat optics provides actor details and intent context for every threat intel-based detection – combining first and third-party intelligence sources.
