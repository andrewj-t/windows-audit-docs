Windows Defender ATP uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:

-   **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors
    collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system
    (for example, process, registry, file, and network communications)
    and sends this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Windows Defender ATP.


-   **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem,
    enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets
    (such as Bing and SmartScreen URL reputation), behavioral signals
    are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses
    to advanced threats.

-   **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Windows Defender ATP to identify attacker
    tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these
    are observed in collected sensor data.






The Windows Defender ATP platform is where all the capabilities that are available across multiple products come together to give security operations teams the ability to effectively manage their organization's network.

To help you maximize the effectiveness of the security platform, you can configure individual capabilities that surface in Windows Defender Security Center.
