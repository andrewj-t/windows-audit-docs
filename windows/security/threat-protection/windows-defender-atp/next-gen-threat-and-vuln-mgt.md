It provides the following solutions to frequently-cited gaps across security operations, security administration, and IT administration workflows and communication. 
- Continuous threat and vulnerability exposure discovery with runtime information
- Real-time endpoint detection and response (EDR) insights correlated with endpoint vulnerabilities
- Linked vulnerability and security configuration assessment data in the context of exposure discovery
- Threat and business context
- Built-in remediation processes through Microsoft Intune and Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager
