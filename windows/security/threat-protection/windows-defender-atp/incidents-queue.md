# Incidents in Windows Defender ATP
**Applies to:**
- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Windows10_Commercial_Comparison.pdf)


When a cybersecurity threat is emerging, or a potential attacker is deploying its tactics, techniques/tools, and procedures (TTPs) on the network, Windows Defender ATP will quickly trigger alerts and launch matching automatic investigations. 

Windows Defender ATP applies correlation analytics and aggregates all related alerts and investigations into an incident. Doing so helps narrate a broader story of an attack, thus providing you with the right visuals (upgraded incident graph) and data representations to understand and deal with complex cross-entity threats to your organization's network.
