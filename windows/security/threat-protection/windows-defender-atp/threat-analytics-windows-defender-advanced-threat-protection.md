# Windows Defender ATP Threat analytics

**Applies to:**

- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

In a volatile security landscape, it's imperative to have the most up-to-date information about threats. More importantly, it's critical to know if your organization is at risk, identify the endpoints that are, and know the steps to take to mitigate it.

Windows Defender ATP Threat analytics is designed to deliver timely information about current security threats. It provides a tailored organizational risk evaluation and specific actionable steps you can take to minimize risks. 

The dashboard shows tiles and the current status of the endpoints in your organization. The individual tiles show how many endpoints require attention based on the threat and helps you identify where you need to apply OS and Microcode mitigation.

You'll gain insight on the overall mitigation status in your organization and see missing mitigations over time. 

## Access Threat analytics
1. From the navigation pane, select **Dashboards** > **Threat analytics**.

2. Take action based on the areas that have been identified to need attention.
