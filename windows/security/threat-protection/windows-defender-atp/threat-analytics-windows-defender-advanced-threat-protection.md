# Windows Defender ATP Threat analytics for Meltdown and Spectre

**Applies to:**

- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

The Threat analytics report provides an overview of the Meltdown and Spectre threat and visibility on both Software and Firmware mitigations status.

The OS mitigation tile provides visibility into OS mitigation status – whether it’s installed and active. You can see and download a CSV format of the list of machines with no OS mitigation active by clicking the inactive machines on the chart.

Microcode mitigations tile provides visibility into Microcode mitigation/update deployment status.
Overall mitigation status provides an aggregated view into OS and Microcode mitigation.


<!--- In a volatile security landscape, it's imperative to have the most up-to-date information about threats. More importantly, it's critical to know if your organization is at risk, identify the endpoints that are, and know the steps to take to mitigate it.

Windows Defender ATP Threat analytics is designed to deliver timely information about current security threats. It provides a tailored organizational risk evaluation and specific actionable steps you can take to minimize risks. 

The dashboard shows tiles and the current status of the endpoints in your organization. The individual tiles show how many endpoints require attention based on the threat and helps you identify where you need to apply OS and Microcode mitigation.

You'll gain insight on the overall mitigation status in your organization and see missing mitigations over time.
