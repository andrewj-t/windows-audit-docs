### Diagnostic data settings
You must ensure that the diagnostic data service is enabled on all the machines in your organization.
By default, this service is enabled, but it's good practice to check to ensure that you'll get sensor data from them.

**Use the command line to check the Windows 10 diagnostic data service startup type**:

1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the machine:

  a.  Go to **Start** and type **cmd**.

  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc qc diagtrack
    ```

If the service is enabled, then the result should look like the following screenshot:

![Result of the sc query command for diagtrack](images/windefatp-sc-qc-diagtrack.png)

If the **START_TYPE** is not set to **AUTO_START**, then you'll need to set the service to automatically start.



**Use the command line to set the Windows 10 diagnostic data service to automatically start:**

1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:

	  a. Go to **Start** and type **cmd**.

    b. Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc config diagtrack start=auto
    ```

3.  A success message is displayed. Verify the change by entering the following command, and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc qc diagtrack
    ```



#### Internet connectivity
Internet connectivity on machines is required either directly or through proxy.

The Windows Defender ATP sensor can utilize a daily average bandwidth of 5MB to communicate with the Windows Defender ATP cloud service and report cyber data. One-off activities such as file uploads and investigation package collection are not included in this daily average bandwidth.

For more information on additional proxy configuration settings see, [Configure machine proxy and Internet connectivity settings](configure-proxy-internet-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) .

Before you onboard machines, the diagnostic data service must be enabled. The service is enabled by default in Windows 10.


## Windows Defender Antivirus configuration requirement
The Windows Defender ATP agent depends on the ability of Windows Defender Antivirus to scan files and provide information about them. 

You must configure Security intelligence updates on the Windows Defender ATP machines whether Windows Defender Antivirus is the active antimalware or not. For more information, see [Manage Windows Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](../windows-defender-antivirus/manage-updates-baselines-windows-defender-antivirus.md).

When Windows Defender Antivirus is not the active antimalware in your organization and you use the Windows Defender ATP service, Windows Defender Antivirus goes on passive mode. If your organization has disabled Windows Defender Antivirus through group policy or other methods, machines that are onboarded to Windows Defender ATP must be excluded from this group policy.

If you are onboarding servers and Windows Defender Antivirus is not the active antimalware on your servers, you shouldn't uninstall Windows Defender Antivirus. You'll need to configure it to run on passive mode. For more information, see [Onboard servers](configure-server-endpoints-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).


For more information, see [Windows Defender Antivirus compatibility](../windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md).

## Windows Defender Antivirus Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver is enabled
If you're running Windows Defender Antivirus as the primary antimalware product on your machines, the Windows Defender ATP agent will successfully onboard.

If you're running a third-party antimalware client and use Mobile Device Management solutions or System Center Configuration Manager (current branch) version 1606, you'll need to ensure that the Windows Defender Antivirus ELAM driver is enabled. For more information, see [Ensure that Windows Defender Antivirus is not disabled by policy](troubleshoot-onboarding-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#ensure-that-windows-defender-antivirus-is-not-disabled-by-a-policy).
