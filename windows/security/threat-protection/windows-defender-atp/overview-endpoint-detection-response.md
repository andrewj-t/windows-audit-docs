# Overview of endpoint detection and response 


The endpoint detection and response capabilities in Windows Defender ATP continuously monitors your organization for possible attacks against systems, networks, or users in your organization. It helps detect, investigate, and quickly respond to threats.

The detection capability finds the attacks that made it past all other defenses and surfaces them through alerts. 

The platform provides various ways for you to investigate an incident and allows you to pivot in various views to help you approach an investigation through multiple possible vectors. 

The response capabilities gives you the power to promptly remediate threats by taking action on the affected entities.
