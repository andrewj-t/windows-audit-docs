# Threat protection report in Windows Defender ATP

**Applies to:**
- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Windows10_Commercial_Comparison.pdf)

[!include[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

The threat protection report provides high-level information about alerts generated in your organization. The report is an overview of the detection sources, categories, severity, status, classification, and determination of these alerts accross time and the current day.

The report provides the following information:

## Alert detection sources
The different sensors and technologies  alerts are coming from in a 30-day and daily view. Detection sources can include endpoint detection and response (EDR), antivirus, and others.

## Alerts by categories
This shows the types of prevalent threats in your organization grouped by alert categories. You'll be able to see the kind of alerts that are most common in your organization and make decisions on where action is most needed. 

## Alert by severity
Identify how many alerts are categorized as high, medium, or low over a 30-day or daily period. 
[ya] we don't have all tiles/cards here, can you go over thhe portal and update them? we need to mak sure it's aliged, the description for every card (without the 30 days explenation.)

## Apply filters to the report
You can apply the following filters to get a more focused view on the cards.
[ya] just saw this, maybe we should add this on the top of the page?


In general, cards are segregated in a 30-day and daily view.
[ya] you can also see 6 months backwoard. we should add something like "you can also see 6 months backwards info by using the "Start date for 30-day cards" filter".
[ya] also, the data is updated to the same date at 1am. maybe it would be good to add this here, what do you think?

[ya] another things we should add is a note, that the filters are applied for all tiles. and that we have a drill down exprience to the filtered alerts list, using all the marked filters once pressing relevant tiles- hope you understand what I was reffering too :)
