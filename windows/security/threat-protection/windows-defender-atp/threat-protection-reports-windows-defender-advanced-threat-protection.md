# Threat protection report in Windows Defender ATP

**Applies to:**
- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Windows10_Commercial_Comparison.pdf)

The threat protection report view is designed to provide immediate information on alert detection sources, categories, severity, and status at a glance in a monthly and a daily view.

In general, cards are segregated in a 30-day and daily view.

## Alert detection sources
This card provides a graphical representation of where alerts are coming from in a 30-day and daily view. Detection sources can include endpoint detection and response (EDR), antivirus, and others.


## Alerts by categories
This shows the types of prevalent threats in your organization grouped by alert categories. You'll be able to see the kind of alerts that are most common in your organization and make decisions on where action is most needed. 

## Alert by severity
Identify how many alerts are of high, medium, or low severity over a 30-day period or daily view.
