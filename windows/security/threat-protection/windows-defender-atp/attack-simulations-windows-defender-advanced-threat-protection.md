# Experience Windows Defender ATP through simulated attacks 

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Windows 10 Education
- Windows 10 Pro
- Windows 10 Pro Education
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

## Preparations

To run the provided simulations, you need at least [one onboarded machine](onboard-configure-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md). 

Before running a simulation, ensure you read the walkthrough document provided with each attack scenario. The document provides detailed instructions as well as specific endpoint OS and application requirements. In general, running the latest Windows build on the test machine helps ensure compatibility.

## Run a simulation

1. Select your desired simulation scenario from from **Help** > **Simulations and tutorials**.

2. Download and read the corresponding walkthrough document thoroughly. The document outlines the nature of the simulation and what you can do to fully experience the scenario.

3. Access **Simulation and tutorials** from the onboarded test machine. From that machine, download the simulation file or copy the simulation script.

4. Run the simulation file or script on the test machine as instructed in the walkthrough document.
