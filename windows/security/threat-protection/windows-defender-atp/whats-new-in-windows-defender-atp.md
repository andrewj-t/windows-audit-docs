# What's new in Windows Defender ATP
**Applies to:**

Here are the new features in the latest release of Windows Defender ATP.

## Windows Defender ATP 1809
- [Threat analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/threat-analytics)<br>
Threat Analytics is a set of interactive reports published by the Windows Defender ATP research team as soon as emerging threats and outbreaks are identified. The reports help security operations teams assess impact on their environment and provides recommended actions to contain, increase organizational resilience, and prevent specific threats.

- [Custom detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/overview-custom-detections)<br>
With custom detections, you can create custom queries to monitor events for any kind of behavior such as suspicious or emerging threats. This can be done by leveraging the power of Advanced hunting through the creation of custom detection rules. 
- [Managed security service provider (MSSP) support](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/mssp-support-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection)<br> 
Windows Defender ATP adds support for this scenario by providing MSSP integration. The integration will allow MSSPs to take the following actions: Get access to MSSP customer's Windows Defender Security Center portal, fetch email notifications, and fetch alerts through security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
- [Integration with Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/configure-server-endpoints-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection#integration-with-azure-security-center)<br> 
Windows Defender ATP integrates with Azure Security Center to provide a comprehensive server protection solution. With this integration Azure Security Center can leverage the power of Windows Defender ATP to provide improved threat detection for Windows Servers.
- [Integration with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/microsoft-cloud-app-security-integration)<br> 
Microsoft Cloud App Security leverages Windows Defender ATP endpoint signals to allow direct visibility into cloud application usage including the use of unsupported cloud services (shadow IT) from all Windows Defender ATP monitored machines.
- [Onboard Windows Server 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/configure-server-endpoints-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection#windows-server-version-1803-and-windows-server-2019) <br>
