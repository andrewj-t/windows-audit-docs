# Microsoft Cloud App Security integration

## Overview

[Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security) gives you visibility into your cloud apps and services by allowing you to control and limit access to cloud apps, while enforcing compliance requirements on data stored in the cloud.

Cloud App Security integrates into your eco-system in two places:

1. Firewall and proxy servers route your endpoints traffic to the web and forward cloud traffic logs to Cloud App Security.

2. Cloud App Security connects to your cloud app public API to enable control and governance of the data stored on cloud apps.
