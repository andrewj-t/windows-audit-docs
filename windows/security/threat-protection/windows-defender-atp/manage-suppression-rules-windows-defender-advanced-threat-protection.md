There might be scenarios where you need to suppress alerts from appearing in the portal. You can create suppression rules for specific alerts that are known to be innocuous such as known tools or processes in your organization. For more information on how to suppress alerts, see [Suppress alerts](manage-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#suppress-alerts).

You can view a list of all the suppression rules and manage them in one place. You can also turn an alert suppression rule on or off.

## Turn a suppression rule on or off
1. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** > **Alert suppression**. The list of suppression rules that users in your organization have created is displayed.

2. Select a rule by clicking on the check-box beside the rule name. 

3. Click **Turn rule on** or **Turn rule off**.
