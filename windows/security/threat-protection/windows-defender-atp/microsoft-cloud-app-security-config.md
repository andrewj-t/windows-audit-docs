# Microsoft Cloud App Security Configuration

To benefit from WDATP cloud app discovery signals, just turn on Microsoft Cloud App Security integration in WDATP Settings page, under Advanced features:

![Advanced features](./images/advanced-features.png)

Once activated, WDATP will immediately start forwarding discovery signals to MCAS.

To view the data collected, browse to Cloud App Security portal (portal.cloudappsecurity.com). Navigate to Cloud Discovery dashboard and select Win10 Endpoint Users report, which contains the data coming from WDATP.

This report is similar to the existing discovery report with one major difference: you can now benefit from visibility to the machine context. Notice the new Machines tab that allows you to view the data split to the device dimensions. This is available in the main report page or any subpage (e.g., when drilling down to a specific cloud app).
