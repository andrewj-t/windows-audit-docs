# Configure and manage Microsoft Threat Experts capabilities
**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Windows10_Commercial_Comparison.pdf)


## Before you begin 
To experience the full Microsoft Threat Experts preview capability in Windows Defender ATP, you need to have a valid Premier customer service and support account. However, Premier charges will not be incurred during the preview.
 
You also need to ensure that you have Windows Defender ATP deployed in your environment with machines enrolled, and not just on a laboratory set-up. 

 
## Register to Microsoft Threat Experts preview 
If you're already a Windows Defender ATP customer, you can apply for preview through the Windows Defender ATP portal. 

1. From the navigation pane, go to **Settings > General > Advanced features > Threat Experts**.

2. Click **Apply for preview**. 

3. In the **Apply for preview** dialog box, read and make sure you understand the preview's terms of agreement.    

4. Enter your name and email address so that Microsoft can get back to you on your application. 

5. Read the privacy statement, then click **Submit** when you're done. 

 >[!NOTE]
 >You will receive a welcome email once your application is approved. Then, from the navigation pane, go to **Settings** > **General** > **Advanced features** to turn the **Threat Experts** toggle on. Click **Save preferences**. 


## Receive targeted attack notification from Microsoft Threat Experts 
You can receive targeted attack notification from Microsoft Threat Experts through the following:  
- The Windows Defender ATP portal's **Alerts** dashboard  
- Your email, if you choose to configure it 

To receive targeted attack notifications through email, you need to create an email notification rule.

### Create an email notification rule 
You can create rules to send email notifications for notification recipients. See Configure alert notifications to create, edit, delete, or troubleshoot email notification, for details.


## View the targeted attack notification  
You'll start receiving targeted attack notification from Microsoft Threat Experts in your email after you have configured your system to receive email notification.  

1. Click the link in the email to go to the corresponding alert context in the dashboard tagged with **Threat experts**. 

2. From the dashboard, select the same alert topic that you got from the email, to view the details.  


## Ask a Microsoft threat expert about suspicious cybersecurity activities in your organization 
You can partner with Microsoft Threat Experts who can be engaged directly from within the Windows Defender Security Center for timely and accurate response. Experts provide insights needed to better understand complex threats, targeted attack notifications that you get, or if you need more information about the alerts, a potentially compromised machine, or a threat intelligence context that you see on your portal dashboard. 

1. Navigate to the portal page with the relevant information that you'd like to investigate, for example, the **Incident** page. Ensure that the page for the relevant alert or machine is in view before raising an inquiry. 
2. From the upper right-hand menu, click **?**, then select **Ask a threat expert**.
3. Asking a threat expert is a two-step process: you need to provide the necessary information and open a support ticket. 
    
    **Step 1: Provide information**    
    a.  Provide enough information to give the Microsoft Threat Experts enough context to start the investigation. Select the inquiry category from the **Provide information > Inquiry** details drop-down menu. <br>      
    
    b.  Enter the additional details to give the threat experts more context of what youâ€™d like to investigate. Click **Next**, and it takes you to the **Open support ticket** tab. <br>
    
    c.  Remember to use the ID number from the **Open a support ticket** tab page and include it to the details you will provide in the subsequent Customer Services and Support (CSS) pages. <br>

    **Step 2: Open a support ticket**
