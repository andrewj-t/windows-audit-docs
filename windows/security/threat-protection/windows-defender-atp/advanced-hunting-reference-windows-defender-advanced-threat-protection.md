## Advanced hunting column reference
To effectively build queries that span multiple tables, you need to understand the columns in the Advanced hunting schema. The following table lists all the available columns, along with their data types and descriptions. This information is also available in the schema representation in the Advanced hunting screen.

| Column name | Data type | Description
:---|:--- |:---
