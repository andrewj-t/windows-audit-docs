# Create machine groups in Windows Defender ATP
**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Windows 10 Education
- Windows 10 Pro
- Windows 10 Pro Education
- Azure Active Directory
- Office 365
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

[!include[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

In a typical enterprise scenario, security operation teams are typically assigned a set of machines. These machines are grouped together based on a set of attributes such as their domains, computer names, or designated tags.

In Windows Defender ATP, you can create machine groups and use them to:
- Limit access to related alerts and data to specific Azure AD user groups with [assigned RBAC roles](rbac-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) 
- Configure different auto-remediation settings for different sets of machines

As part of the process of creating a machine group, you'll:
- Set the automated remediation level for that group
- Define a matching rule based on the machine name, domain, tags, and OS platform to determine which machines belong to the group. If a machine is also matched to other groups, it is added only to the highest ranked machine group.
- Determine access to machine group
- Rank the machine group relative to other groups after it is created 

## Add a machine group

1.	In the navigation pane, select **Settings > Permissions > Machine groups**.

2.	Click **Add machine group**. 

3.	Set the machine group details, configure an association rule, preview the results, then assign the group to an Azure user group:

	 - **Name**

	 - **Remediation level for automated investigations**
	  - **No remediation**
	  - **Require approval (all folders)**
	  - **Require approval (non-temp folders)**
	  - **Require approval (core folders)**
	  - **Fully automated**

	 - **Description**

	 - **Matching rule** â€“ you can apply the rule based on machine name, domain, tag, or OS version. 

		>[!TIP]
		>If you want to group machines by organizational unit, you can configure the registry key for the group affiliation. For more information on device tagging, see [Manage machine group and tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/investigate-machines-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection#manage-machine-group-and-tags).

4.	Review the result of the preview of matched machines. If you are satisfied with the rules, click the **Access** tab.

5.	Assign the user groups that can access the machine group you created. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can only grant access to Azure AD user groups with assigned RBAC roles. 

6.	Click **Close**.

7.	Apply the configuration settings.

## Understand matching and manage groups

You can promote the rank of a machine group so that it is given higher priority during matching. When a machine is matched to more than one group, it is added only to the highest ranked group.

Machines that are not matched to any groups are added to **Ungrouped machines**. By default, remediations performed on machines in this group require approval, but you can also define the remediation level for this group.

You can also edit and delete groups.
