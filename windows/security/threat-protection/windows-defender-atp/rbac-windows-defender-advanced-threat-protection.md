Using role-based access control (RBAC), you can create roles and groups within your security operations team to grant appropriate access to the  portal. Based on the roles and groups you create, you have fine-grained control over what users with access to the portal can see and do. 

Large geo-distributed security operations teams typically adopt a tier-based model to assign and authorize access to security portals. Typical tiers include the following three levels:

Tier | Description
:---|:---
Tier 1 | **Local security operations team / IT team** <br> This team usually triages and investigates alerts contained within their geolocation and escalates to Tier 2 in cases where an active remediation is required.
Tier 2 | **Regional security operations team** <br> This team can see all the machines for their region and perform remediation actions.
Tier 3 | **Global security operations team** <br> This team consists of security experts and are authorized to see and perform all actions from the portal.

Windows Defender ATP RBAC is designed to support your tier- or role-based model of choice and gives you granular control over what roles can see, machines they can access, and actions they can take. The RBAC framework is centered around the following controls:

- **Control who can take specific action**
  - Create custom roles and control what Windows Defender ATP capabilities they can access with granularity.
 
- **Control who can see information on specific machine group or groups**
  - [Create machine groups](machine-groups-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) by specific criteria such as names, tags, domains, and others, then grant role access to them using a specific Azure AD user group.

To implement role-based access, you'll need to define admin roles, assign corresponding permissions, and assign Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user groups assigned to the roles.


### Before you begin

> [!WARNING]
> Before enabling the feature, it's important that you have a Global Administrator role in Azure AD and that have your Azure AD groups ready to reduce the risk of being locked out of the portal. 

When you first log in to the Windows Defender ATP portal, you're granted either full access or read only access. Full access rights are granted to users with Security Administrator or Global Administrator roles in Azure AD. Read only access is granted to users with a Security Reader role in Azure AD. 

> [!WARNING]
> Only those with Azure AD Global Administrator rights will be able to create and assign roles in the Windows Defender ATP portal, therefore, having the right groups ready in Azure AD is important.
>
> **Turning on role-based access control will cause users with read-only permissions to lose access until they are assigned to a role.** 
>
>Users with admin permissions are automatically assigned the default Windows Defender ATP global administrator role with full permissions.
>
> After opting in to use RBAC, you cannot revert to the initial roles as when you first logged into the portal. 

## Create user roles and assign the role to a group

1.	In the navigation pane, select **Settings > Role based access control > Roles**.

2.	Click **Add new role**. 

3.	Enter the user group name, description, and active permissions youâ€™d like to assign to the group.

	 - **User group name**

	 - **Description**

	 - **Active permissions**
		  - **View data** - Users can view information in the portal.
		  - **Investigate alerts** - Users can manage alerts, initiate automated investigations, collect investigation packages, manage machine tags, and export machine timeline.
		  - **Approve or take action** - Users can take response actions and approve or dismiss pending remediation actions.
		  - **Manage system settings** - Users can configure settings, SIEM and threat intel API settings, advanced settings, preview features, and automated file uploads.
		  
4.	Click **Next** to assign the user to a group.

5.	Use the filter to select the Azure AD group that you'd like the user to be a part of.

6.	Click **Save and close**.

7.	Apply the configuration settings.

## Edit user roles

1.	Select the user role you'd like to edit.

2.	Click **Edit**.
