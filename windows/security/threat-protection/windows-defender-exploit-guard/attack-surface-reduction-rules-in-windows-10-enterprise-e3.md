# Use attack surface reduction rules in Windows 10 Enterprise E3

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Enterprise E3

Attack surface reduction rules help prevent actions and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines. 

Attack surface reduction rules work best with [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md), which requires a Windows 10 Enterprise E5 license. Windows Defender ATP provides detailed reporting into events and blocks as part of its [alert investigation scenarios](../windows-defender-atp/investigate-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).

However, you can use a limited subset of attack surface reduction rules in Windows 10 Enterprise E3 if you are able to either develop your own reporting, monitoring, and analytics or hook into an existing solution in your environment.

Attack surface reduction rules are supported on Windows Server 2019 as well as Windows 10 clients.

## Attack surface reduction rules

The following attack surface reduction rules are available with a Windows 10 Enterprise E3 license:

- Block executable content from email client and webmail
- Block all Office applications from creating child processes
- Block Office applications from creating executable content
- Block Office applications from injecting code into other processes
- Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content
- Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts
- Block Win32 API calls from Office macro
- Use advanced protection against ransomware
- Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)
- Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands
- Block untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB

For more information about these rules, see [Reduce attack surfaces with attack surface reduction rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard).
