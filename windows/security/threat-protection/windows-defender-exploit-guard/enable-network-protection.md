# Enable network protection

**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

[Network protection](network-protection-exploit-guard.md) helps to prevent employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet. 
You can enable network protection by using any of the these methods:

- Windows Security app
- Intune
- MDM
- Group Policy
- SCCM 
- PowerShell cmdlets

You can also [audit network protection](evaluate-network-protection.md) to see which apps would be blocked before you enable it.  

## Windows Security app

1. Click **Start**, type **Windows Security** and press Enter to open the app.
1. Click 

## Intune

## MDM

Use the [./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/EnableNetworkProtection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-enablenetworkprotection) configuration service provider (CSP) to enable and configure network protection.

## Group Policy 

1.  On your Group Policy management computer, open the [Group Policy Management Console](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731212.aspx), right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click **Edit**.

2.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** go to **Computer configuration** and click **Administrative templates**.

3.  Expand the tree to **Windows components** > **Windows Defender Antivirus** > **Windows Defender Exploit Guard** > **Network protection**.

4. Double-click the **Prevent users and apps from accessing dangerous websites** setting and set the option to **Enabled**. In the options section, you must specify one of the following:
    - **Block** - Users will not be able to access malicious IP addresses and domains
    - **Disable (Default)** - The Network protection feature will not work. Users will not be blocked from accessing malicious domains
    - **Audit Mode** - If a user visits a malicious IP address or domain, an event will be recorded in the Windows event log but the user will not be blocked from visiting the address.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>To fully enable network protection, you must set the Group Policy option to **Enabled** and also select **Block** in the options drop-down menu.

## SCCM

## PowerShell

1. Type **powershell** in the Start menu, right click **Windows PowerShell** and click **Run as administrator**
2. Enter the following cmdlet:

    ```
    Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled
    ```

You can enable the feature in audit mode using the following cmdlet:

```
Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode
```

Use `Disabled` insead of `AuditMode` or `Enabled` to turn the feature off.
