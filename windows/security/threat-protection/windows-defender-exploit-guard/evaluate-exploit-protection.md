# Evaluate exploit protection

**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

[Exploit protection](exploit-protection-exploit-guard.md) helps protect devices from malware that uses exploits to spread and infect other devices. 
It consists of a number of mitigations that can be applied to either the operating system or an individual app.
Many of the features that were part of the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751) are included in exploit protection. 

This topic helps you enable exploit protection in audit mode and review related events in Event Viewer. 
You can enable audit mode for any mitigation to see how it will work in a test environment.
This lets you see a record of what *would* have happened if you had enabled the mitigation in production.
You can make sure it doesn't affect your line-of-business apps, and see which suspicious or malicious events occur.

>[!TIP]
>You can also visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the feature is working and see how it works.

## Use audit mode to measure impact

1. Go to the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) and download the [EP xml config file](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com/Content/ProcessMitigation.xml?).

1. Open an elevated PowerShell windows and run:

   ```powershell
   Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath ProcessMitigation.xml 
   Set-ProcessMitigation â€“help
   ``` 
   
1. Tp verify the configuration, run:

   ```powershell 
   Get-ProcessMitigation
   ```

2. Type **event viewer** in the Start menu and open **Event Viewer**.

3. Click **Action** > **Import Custom View...**

    ![Animation highlighting Import custom view on the left of Event viewer](images/events-import.gif)

4. Select the XML > **Open** > **OK**. 

You can see the [**PowerShell reference** section in customize exploit protection](customize-exploit-protection.md#powershell-reference) for a list of which mitigations can be audited and instructions on enabling the mode.
