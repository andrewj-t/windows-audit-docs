# Evaluate exploit protection

**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

[Exploit protection](exploit-protection-exploit-guard.md) helps protect devices from malware that uses exploits to spread and infect other devices. 
It consists of a number of mitigations that can be applied to either the operating system or an individual app.
Many of the features that were part of the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751) are included in exploit protection. 

This topic helps you enable exploit protection in audit mode and review related events in Event Viewer. 
You can enable audit mode for certain app-level mitigations to see how they will work in a test environment.
This lets you see a record of what *would* have happened if you had enabled the mitigation in production.
You can make sure it doesn't affect your line-of-business apps, and see which suspicious or malicious events occur.

>[!TIP]
>You can also visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to see how exploit protection works.

## Enable exploit protection in audit mode

To set app-level mitigations to audit mode, use `Set-ProcessMitigation` with the **Audit mode** cmdlet. 

Configure each mitigation in the following format:


```PowerShell
Set-ProcessMitigation -<scope> <app executable> -<action> <mitigation or options>,<mitigation or options>,<mitigation or options>
```

Where:

- \<Scope>:
    - `-Name` to indicate the mitigations should be applied to a specific app. Specify the app's executable after this flag.
- \<Action>:
    - `-Enable` to enable the mitigation
    - `-Disable` to disable the mitigation
- \<Mitigation>:
    - The mitigation's cmdlet as defined in the following table. Each mitigation is separated with a comma.

| Mitigation | Audit mode cmdlet |
| - | - |
|Arbitrary code guard (ACG) |  AuditDynamicCode |
|Block low integrity images |  AuditImageLoad   |
|Block untrusted fonts | AuditFont,   FontAuditOnly |
|Code integrity guard |   AuditMicrosoftSigned,   AuditStoreSigned |
|Disable Win32k system calls  |   AuditSystemCall |
|Do not allow child processes |   AuditChildProcess |

For example, to enable Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG) in audit mode for an app named *testing.exe*, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-ProcesMitigation -Name c:\apps\lob\tests\testing.exe -Enable AuditDynamicCode
```

You can disable audit mode by replacing `-Enable` with `-Disable`.

## Review exploit protection audit events

To review which apps would have been blocked, open Event Viewer and filter for the following events in the Security-Mitigations log.

Feature | Provider/source | Event ID | Description
:-|:-|:-:|:-
Exploit protection | Security-Mitigations (Kernel Mode/User Mode) | 1 | ACG audit
Exploit protection | Security-Mitigations (Kernel Mode/User Mode) | 3 | Do not allow child processes audit
Exploit protection | Security-Mitigations (Kernel Mode/User Mode) | 5 | Block low integrity images audit
Exploit protection | Security-Mitigations (Kernel Mode/User Mode) | 7 | Block remote images audit
Exploit protection | Security-Mitigations (Kernel Mode/User Mode) | 9 | Disable win32k system calls audit
Exploit protection | Security-Mitigations (Kernel Mode/User Mode) | 11 | Code integrity guard audit
