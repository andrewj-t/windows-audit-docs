# Evaluate network protection

**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Network protection helps prevent employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet.

This topic helps you evaluate Network protection by enabling the feature and guiding you to a testing site.

>[!NOTE]
>The site will replicate the behavior that would happen if a user visted a malicious site or domain. The sites in this evaluation topic are not malicious, they are specially created websites that pretend to be malicious.

>[!TIP]
>You can also visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the feature is working and see how it works.

## Enable network protection

1. Type **powershell** in the Start menu, right click **Windows PowerShell** and click **Run as administrator**
2. Enter the following cmdlet:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled
    ```

You can also carry out the processes described in this topic in audit or disabled mode to see how the feature will work. Use the same PowerShell cmdlet as above, but replace "Enabled" with either "AuditMode" or "Disabled".

### Visit a (fake) malicious domain

1. Open Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or any other browser of your choice.

1. Go to [https://smartscreentestratings2.net](https://smartscreentestratings2.net).

You will get a 403 Forbidden response in the browser, and you will see a notification that the network connnection was blocked.

## Review network protection events in Windows Event Viewer
 
You can also review the Windows event log to see the events there were created when performing the demo. You can use the custom view below or [locate them manually](event-views-exploit-guard.md#list-of-attack-surface-reduction-events).

1. Type **Event viewer** in the Start menu to open the Windows Event Viewer.

2. On the left panel, under **Actions**, click **Import custom view...**

3. Navigate to the Exploit Guard Evaluation Package, and select the file *np-events.xml*. Alternatively, [copy the XML directly](event-views-exploit-guard.md).

4. Click **OK**.

5. This will create a custom view that filters to only show the following events related to network protection:

Event ID | Description
-|-
5007 | Event when settings are changed
1125 | Event when rule fires in audit mode 
1126 | Event when rule fires in block mode 


## Use audit mode to measure impact

You can also enable the network protection feature in audit mode. This lets you see a record of which IP addresses and domains would have been blocked if the feature were enabled.

You might want to do this when testing how the feature will work in your organization, to ensure it doesn't affect your line-of-business apps, and to get an idea of how often the feature will block connections during normal use.

To enable audit mode, use the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode
```
>[!TIP]
>If you want to fully audit how network protection will work in your organization, you'll need to use a management tool to deploy this setting to machines in your network(s).
You can also use Group Policy, Intune, or MDM CSPs to configure and deploy the setting, as described in the main [Network protection topic](network-protection-exploit-guard.md).
