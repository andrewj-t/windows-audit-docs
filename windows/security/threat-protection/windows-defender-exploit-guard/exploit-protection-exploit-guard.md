# Protect devices from exploits

**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Windows10_Commercial_Comparison.pdf)

Exploit protection automatically applies a number of exploit mitigation techniques on both the operating system processes and on individual apps. 

It is part of [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](windows-defender-exploit-guard.md). Exploit protection is supported on Windows 10, version 1709 and later and Windows Server 2016, version 1803 or later.

>[!TIP]
>You can visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the feature is working and see how it works.

Exploit protection works best with [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) - which gives you detailed reporting into exploit protection events and blocks as part of the usual [alert investigation scenarios](../windows-defender-atp/investigate-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).

 You [configure these settings using the Windows Security app or PowerShell](customize-exploit-protection.md) on an individual machine, and then [export the configuration as an XML file that you can deploy to other machines](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md). You can use Group Policy to distribute the XML file to multiple devices at once.

 When a mitigation is encountered on the machine, a notification will be displayed from the Action Center. You can [customize the notification](customize-attack-surface-reduction.md#customize-the-notification) with your company details and contact information. You can also enable the rules individually to customize what techniques the feature monitors.

  You can also use [audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) to evaluate how exploit protection would impact your organization if it were enabled.

 Many of the features in the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751) have been included in Exploit protection, and you can convert and import existing EMET configuration profiles into Exploit protection. See [Comparison between Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit and Windows Defender Exploit Guard](emet-exploit-protection-exploit-guard.md) for more information on how Exploit protection supersedes EMET and what the benefits are when considering moving to exploit protection on Windows 10. 

 >[!IMPORTANT]
 >If you are currently using EMET you should be aware that [EMET reached end of life on July 31, 2018](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2016/11/03/beyond-emet/). You should consider replacing EMET with exploit protection in Windows 10. You can [convert an existing EMET configuration file into exploit protection](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md#convert-an-emet-configuration-file-to-an-exploit-protection-configuration-file) to make the migration easier and keep your existing settings.

>[!WARNING] 
>Some security mitigation technologies may have compatibility issues with some applications. You should test exploit protection in all target use scenarios by using [audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) before deploying the configuration across a production environment or the rest of your network.

 ## Review exploit protection events in Windows Event Viewer

You can review the Windows event log to see events that are created when exploit protection blocks (or audits) an app:

1. Download the [Exploit Guard Evaluation Package](https://aka.ms/mp7z2w) and extract the file *ep-events.xml* to an easily accessible location on the machine.

2. Type **Event viewer** in the Start menu to open the Windows Event Viewer.

3. On the left panel, under **Actions**, click **Import custom view...**

    ![Antimated GIF highlighting the import custom view button on the right pane ](images/events-import.gif)

4. Navigate to where you extracted *ep-events.xml* and select it. Alternatively, [copy the XML directly](event-views-exploit-guard.md).

5. Click **OK**.

6. This will create a custom view that filters to only show the following events related to Exploit protection:

Provider/source | Event ID | Description
-|:-:|-
Security-Mitigations | 1 | ACG audit
Security-Mitigations | 2 | ACG enforce
Security-Mitigations | 3 | Do not allow child processes audit

This topic describes the differences between the Enhance Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and exploit protection in Windows Defender ATP. 
 
Exploit protection in Windows Defender ATP is our successor to EMET and provides stronger protection, more customization, an easier user interface, and better configuration and management options.

EMET is a standalone product for earlier versions of Windows and provides some mitigation against older, known exploit techniques.

After July 31, 2018, it will not be supported.

For more information about the individual features and mitigations available in Windows Defender ATP, as well as how to enable, configure, and deploy them to better protect your network, see the following topics:

- [Protect devices from exploits](exploit-protection-exploit-guard.md)
- [Configure and audit Exploit protection mitigations](customize-exploit-protection.md)
