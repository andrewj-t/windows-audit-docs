# Reduce attack surfaces with attack surface reduction rules 

**Applies to:**

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Windows10_Commercial_Comparison.pdf)

Attack surface reduction rules help prevent behaviors malware often uses to infect computers with malicious code. You can set attack surface reduction rules for computers running Windows 10, version 1803 or later, or Windows Server 2019. 

To use attack surface reduction rules, you need a Windows 10 Enterprise E3 license or higher. An E5 license lets you take advantage of the advanced monitoring and reporting capabilities available in [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) and the real-time views and configuration of the M365 dashboard. These advanced capabilities aren't available with an E3 license, but you can develop your own monitoring and reporting tools to view attack surface reduction rule events in Event Viewer.

Attack surface reduction rules target specific behaviors that malware and malicious apps typically use to infect computers, including:

- Executable files and scripts used in Office apps or web mail that attempt to download or run files
- Obfuscated or otherwise suspicious scripts
- Behaviors that apps don't usually initiate during normal day-to-day work

Because legitimate, line-of-business applications might also use some of these behaviors and apps, you can [exclude them from attack surface reduction rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-attack-surface-reduction#exclude-files-and-folders-from-asr-rules).

You can use [audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) to evaluate how attack surface reduction rules would impact your organization if they were enabled. It's best to run all rules in audit mode first so you can understand their impact on your line-of-business applications. Many line-of-business applications are written with limited security concerns, and they may perform tasks similar to malware. By monitoring audit data and adding exclusions for necessary applications, you can deploy attack surface reduction rules without impacting productivity.

Triggered rules display a notification on the device. The notification also displays in the Windows Defender ATP Security Center and on the M365 console. You can [customize the notification](customize-attack-surface-reduction.md#customize-the-notification) with your company details and contact information.

You can set attack surface reduction rules in [audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) to evaluate how they'd impact your organization once enabled.

For information about configuring attack surface reduction rules, see [Enable attack surface reduction rules](enable-attack-surface-reduction.md).

## Attack surface reduction rules

Each rule description indicates which apps or file types the rule applies to. In general, the rules for Office apps apply to only Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, or they apply to Outlook. They don't apply to any other Office apps like Flow or Teams.

In general, attack surface reduction rules apply to the following Office apps:

- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Microsoft OneNote

Except where specified, attack surface reduction rules don't apply to any other Office apps.

### Block executable content from email client and webmail

This rule blocks the following file types from launching from email in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook.com and other popular webmail providers:

- Executable files (such as .exe, .dll, or .scr) 
- Script files (such as a PowerShell .ps, VisualBasic .vbs, or JavaScript .js file)

Intune name: Execution of executable content (exe, dll, ps, js, vbs, etc.) dropped from email (webmail/mail client) (no exceptions)

SCCM name: Block executable content from email client and webmail

GUID: BE9BA2D9-53EA-4CDC-84E5-9B1EEEE46550

### Block all Office applications from creating child processes

This rule blocks Office apps from creating child processes. This includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Access.

This is a typical malware behavior, especially for macro-based attacks that attempt to use Office apps to launch or download malicious executables. Some legitimate line-of-business applications might also use behaviors like this, including spawning a command prompt or using PowerShell to configure registry settings.

Intune name: Office apps launching child processes

SCCM name: Block Office application from creating child processes

GUID: D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A

### Block Office applications from creating executable content

This rule prevents Office apps, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, from creating executable content. 

This rule targets typical behaviors used by suspicious and malicious add-ons and scripts (extensions) that create or launch executable files. This is a typical malware technique, which often embeds an encoded binary file within the script that is then dropped and executed.

Office apps won't be able to use extensions. Typically, these extensions use the Windows Scripting Host (.wsh files) to run scripts that automate certain tasks or provide user-created add-on features.

Intune name: Office apps/macros creating executable content

SCCM name: Block Office applications from creating executable content

GUID: 3B576869-A4EC-4529-8536-B80A7769E899

### Block Office applications from injecting code into other processes

Attackers might attempt to use Office apps to migrate malicious code into other processes through code injection, so the code can masquerade as a clean process. This rule blocks code injection attempts from Office apps into other processes. There are no known legitimate business purposes for using code injection.

This rule applies to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. 

Intune name: Office apps injecting code into other processes (no exceptions)

SCCM name: Block Office applications from injecting code into other processes

GUID: 75668C1F-73B5-4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84

### Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content

Malware often uses JavaScript and VBScript scripts to launch other malicious apps. 

This rule prevents scripts from launching apps, helping to prevent malicious use of the scripts to spread malware and infect machines. This isn't a common line-of-business use, but line-of-business applications sometimes use scripts to download and launch installers.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>File and folder exclusions don't apply to this attack surface reduction rule.

Intune name: js/vbs executing payload downloaded from Internet (no exceptions)

SCCM name: Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content

GUID: D3E037E1-3EB8-44C8-A917-57927947596D

### Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts

Script obfuscation is a common technique that both malware authors and legitimate applications use to hide intellectual property or decrease script loading times. This rule detects suspicious properties within an obfuscated script.

This rule blocks scripts from running downloaded content, preventing malicious use of the scripts to spread malware and infect computers. You can exclude scripts so they're allowed to run.

Intune name: Obfuscated js/vbs/ps/macro code

SCCM name: Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts.

GUID: 5BEB7EFE-FD9A-4556-801D-275E5FFC04CC

### Block Win32 API calls from Office macros

Office VBA provides the ability to use Win32 API calls, which malicious code can abuse. Most organizations don't use this functionality, but might still rely on using other macro capabilities. This rule allows you to prevent using Win32 APIs in VBA macros, which reduces the attack surface.

Intune name: Win32 imports from Office macro code

SCCM name: Block Win32 API calls from Office macros

GUID: 92E97FA1-2EDF-4476-BDD6-9DD0B4DDDC7B

### Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion
 
This rule blocks the following file types from launching unless they either meet prevalence or age criteria, or they're in a trusted list or exclusion list:
 
- Executable files (such as .exe, .dll, or .scr) 

>[!NOTE]
>You must [enable cloud-delivered protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus) to use this rule.

Intune name: Executables that don't meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criteria

SCCM name: Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criteria

GUID: 01443614-cd74-433a-b99e-2ecdc07bfc25
 
### Use advanced protection against ransomware
 
This rule provides an extra layer of protection against ransomware. It scans executable files entering the system to determine whether they're trustworthy. If the files closely resemble ransomware, this rule blocks them from running, unless they're in a trusted list or exclusion list.

>[!NOTE]
>You must [enable cloud-delivered protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus) to use this rule.

Intune name: Advanced ransomware protection

SCCM name: Use advanced protection against ransomware

GUID: c1db55ab-c21a-4637-bb3f-a12568109d35
 
### Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)
 
Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) authenticates users who log in to a Windows computer. Windows Defender Credential Guard in Windows 10 normally prevents attempts to extract credentials from LSASS. However, some organizations can't enable Credential Guard on all of their computers because of compatibility issues with custom smartcard drivers or other programs that load into the Local Security Authority (LSA). In these cases, attackers can use tools like Mimikatz to scrape cleartext passwords and NTLM hashes from LSASS. This rule helps mitigate that risk by locking down LSASS.

 >[!NOTE]
 >In some apps, the code enumerates all running processes and attempts to open them with exhaustive permissions. This rule denies the app's process open action and logs the details to the security event log. This rule can generate a lot of noise. If you have an app that overly enumerates LSASS, you need to add it to the exclusion list. By itself, this event log entry doesn't necessarily indicate a malicious threat.

Intune name: Flag credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem

SCCM name: Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem

GUID: 9e6c4e1f-7d60-472f-ba1a-a39ef669e4b2

### Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands

This rule blocks processes through PsExec and WMI commands from running, to prevent remote code execution that can spread malware attacks.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>File and folder exclusions do not apply to this attack surface reduction rule.

>[!WARNING]
>Only use this rule if you're managing your devices with [Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune) or another MDM solution. This rule is incompatible with management through [System Center Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm) because this rule blocks WMI commands the SCCM client uses to function correctly.

Intune name: Process creation from PSExec and WMI commands

SCCM name: Not applicable

GUID: d1e49aac-8f56-4280-b9ba-993a6d77406c
 
### Block untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB
 
With this rule, admins can prevent unsigned or untrusted executable files from running from USB removable drives, including SD cards. Blocked file types include:
 
- Executable files (such as .exe, .dll, or .scr) 
- Script files (such as a PowerShell .ps, VisualBasic .vbs, or JavaScript .js file)

Intune name: Untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB

SCCM name: Block untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB

GUID: b2b3f03d-6a65-4f7b-a9c7-1c7ef74a9ba4

### Block Office communication application from creating child processes

This rule prevents Outlook from creating child processes. It prevents apps from launching when a user double-clicks an attachment or clicks a link embedded in an email. It also protects against [Outlook rules and forms exploits](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office365security/defending-against-rules-and-forms-injection/) that attackers can use when a user's credentials are compromised.

>[!NOTE]
>This rule applies to Outlook and Outlook.com only.

Intune name: Not applicable

SCCM name: Not applicable

GUID: 26190899-1602-49e8-8b27-eb1d0a1ce869

### Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes

Through social engineering or exploits, malware can download and launch additional payloads and break out of Adobe Reader. This rule prevents attacks like this by blocking Adobe Reader from creating additional processes. 

Intune name: Not applicable

SCCM name: Not applicable

GUID: 7674ba52-37eb-4a4f-a9a1-f0f9a1619a2c
