# Enable virtualization-based protection of code integrity 

**Applies to**  

- Windows 10
- Windows Server 2016 

Virtualization-based protection of code integrity (herein referred to as hypervisor-protected code integrity, or HVCI) is a powerful system mitigation that leverages hardware virtualization and the Windows Hyper-V hypervisor to protect Windows kernel-mode processes against the injection and execution of malicious or unverified code. 
Code integrity validation is performed in a secure environment that is resistant to attack from malicious software, and page permissions for kernel mode are set and maintained by the Hyper-V hypervisor.  

Some applications, including device drivers, may be incompatible with HVCI. 
This can cause devices or software to malfunction and in rare cases may result in a Blue Screen. Such issues may occur after HVCI has been turned on or during the enablement process itself. 
If this happens, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for remediation steps. 

## How to turn on HVCI in Windows 10 version 1803

Beginning with Windows 10, version 1803, HVCI is enabled automatically on devices that support virtualization based security (VBS). HVCI can also be enabled using any of these options:
- [Windows Defender Security Center](#enable-hvci-using-windows-defender-security-center) 
- [Group Policy](#enable-hvci-using-group-policy)
- Windows Intune (or another MDM provider)
- [System Center Configuration Manager](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2015/10/30/managing-windows-10-device-guard-with-configuration-manager/) 


### Enable HVCI using Windows Defender Security Center

You can use Windows Defender Security Center to enable HVCI on a workgroup computer beginning with Windows 10, version 1803.

1. Click **Start** > **Settings** > **Update & security** > **Windows Security** > **Open Windows Defender Security Center**.
2. In Windows Defender security center, click **Device Security** > **Core isolation** > **Memory integrity**. 

### Enable HVCI using Group Policy

You can use Group Policy to enable HVCI across an enterprise.

1. Use Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) to either edit an existing GPO or create a new one.
2. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **Device Guard**.  
3. Double-click **Turn on Virtualization Based Security**.
4. Click **Enabled** and under **Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity**, select **Enabled with UEFI lock** to ensure HVCI cannot be enabled remotely or select **Enabled without UEFI lock**.

5. Click **Ok** to close the editor.

To apply the new policy on a domain-joined computer, either restart or run `gpupdate /force` in an elevated command prompt. 

## How to turn on HVCI in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (version 1709) 

These steps apply to Windows 10 S, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, and Windows 10 Education. 

The following instructions are intended for Windows 10 client systems running the Fall Creators Update (version 1709) that have hypervisor support and that are not already using a [Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/10/23/introducing-windows-defender-application-control/) policy. 
If your device already has a WDAC policy (SIPolicy.p7b), please contact your IT administrator to request HVCI. 

> [!NOTE]
> You must be an administrator to perform this procedure. 

1. Download the [Enable HVCI cabinet file](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/A/F/7AFBCDD1-578B-49B0-9B27-988EAEA89A8B/EnableHVCI.cab).

2. Open the cabinet file.

3. Right-click the SIPolicy.p7b file and extract it. Then move it to the following location: 

   C:\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity

   > [!NOTE]
   > Do not perform this step if a SIPolicy.p7b file is already in this location.

4. Turn on the hypervisor:

   a. Click Start, type **Turn Windows Features on or off** and press ENTER. 

   b. Select **Hyper-V** > **Hyper-V Platform** > **Hyper-V Hypervisor** and click **OK**.  

      ![Turn Windows features on or off](images\turn-windows-features-on-or-off.png)

   c. After the installation completes, restart your computer. 

5. To confirm HVCI was successfully enabled, open **System Information** and check **Virtualization-based security Services Running**, which should now display **Hypervisor enforced Code Integrity**.      


## Troubleshooting

A. If a device driver fails to load or crashes at runtime, you may be able to update the driver using **Device Manager**.

B. If you experience software or device malfunction after using the above procedure to turn on HVCI, but you are able to log in to Windows, you can turn off HVCI by renaming or deleting the SIPolicy.p7b file from the file location in step 3 above and then restart your device.

C. If you experience a critical error during boot or your system is unstable after using the above procedure to turn on HVCI, you can recover using the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE). To boot to Windows RE, see [Windows RE Technical Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-recovery-environment--windows-re--technical-reference). After logging in to Windows RE, you can turn off HVCI by renaming or deleting the SIPolicy.p7b file from the file location in step 3 above and then restart your device.

## How to turn off HVCI on the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update

1.	Rename or delete the SIPolicy.p7b file located at C:\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity.
2.	Restart the device.
3.	To confirm HVCI has been successfully disabled, open System Information and check **Virtualization-based security Services Running**, which should now have no value displayed.

## HVCI deployment in virtual machines

HVCI can protect a Hyper-V virtual machine, just as it would a physical machine. The steps to enable WDAC are the same from within the virtual machine.

WDAC protects against malware running in the guest virtual machine. It does not provide additional protection from the host administrator. From the host, you can disable WDAC for a virtual machine:

```powershell
Set-VMSecurity -VMName <VMName> -VirtualizationBasedSecurityOptOut $true
```

### Requirements for running HVCI in Hyper-V virtual machines 
 -   The Hyper-V host must run at least Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 version 1607.
 -   The Hyper-V virtual machine must be Generation 2, and running at least Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10. 
 -   HVCI and [nested virtualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization) cannot be enabled at the same time. 
 -   Virtual Fibre Channel adapters are not compatible with HVCI. Before attaching a virtual Fibre Channel Adapter to a virtual machine, you must first opt out of virtualization-based security using `Set-VMSecurity`.
 -   The AllowFullSCSICommandSet option for pass-through disks is not compatible with HVCI. Before configuring a pass-through disk with AllowFullSCSICommandSet, you must first opt out of virtualization-based security using `Set-VMSecurity`.
