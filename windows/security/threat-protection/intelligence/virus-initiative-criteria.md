# Microsoft Virus Initiative

The Microsoft Virus Initiative (MVI) helps organizations to get their products working and integrated with Windows.

Like the [Virus Information Alliance (VIA)](virus-information-alliance-criteria.md) and the [Coordinated Malware Eradication (CME) program](coordinated-malware-eradication.md), MVI aims to share information about the threat landscape that can help your organization protect its customers.

MVI members will receive access to Windows APIs (such as those used by Windows Defender Security Center, IOAV, AMSI and Cloud Files), malware telemetry and samples, and invitations to security related events and conferences.

MVI adds to VIA by requiring members to develop and own antimalware technology, and to be present in the antimalware industry community.

## Join MVI

A request for membership is made by an individual as a representative of an organization that develops and produces antimalware or antivirus technology.

The base criteria for MVI membership are the same as for VIA, but your organization must also offer an antimalware or antivirus product.

### Initial selection criteria

Your organization must meet the following eligibility requirements to participate in the MVI program:

1. Offer an antimalware or antivirus product that is one of the following:

   * Your organization's own creation.
   * Licensed from another organization, but your organization adds value such as additional Security intelligence.
   * Developed by using an SDK (engine and other components) from another MVI Partner AM company and your organization adds a custom UI and/or other functionality (white box versions).

2. Have your own malware research team unless you distribute a Whitebox product.

3. Be active and have a positive reputation in the antimalware industry. Your organization is:

   * Certified through independent testing by an industry standard organization such as [ICSA Labs](https://www.icsalabs.com/), [West Coast Labs](http://www.westcoastlabs.com/), [PCSL IT Consulting Institute](https://www.pitci.net/), or [SKD Labs](http://www.skdlabs.com/html/english/).
   * Be active in the antimalware industry. For example, participate in industry conferences, be reviewed in an industry standard report such as AV Comparatives, OPSWAT or Gartner.

4. Be willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Microsoft.

5. Be willing to sign a program license agreement.

6. Be willing to adhere to program requirements for AM apps. These requirements define the behavior of AM apps necessary to ensure proper interaction with Windows.

7. Submit your AM app to Microsoft for periodic performance testing.
