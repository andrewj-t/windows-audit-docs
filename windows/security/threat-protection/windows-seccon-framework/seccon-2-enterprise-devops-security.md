# SECCON 2 enterprise devops security

**Applies to**  

-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016 
-   Office 2016 

We recommend this configuration for developers and testers, who are an attractive target both for supply chain attacks and access to servers and systems containing high value data or where critical business functions could be disrupted. SecCon 2 guidance is coming soon!
