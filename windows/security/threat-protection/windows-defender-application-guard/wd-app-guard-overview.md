# Windows Defender Application Guard overview

**Applies to:** [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)
 
Windows Defender Application Guard (Application Guard) is designed to help prevent old and newly emerging attacks to help keep employees productive. Using our unique hardware isolation approach, our goal is to destroy the playbook that attackers use by making current attack methods obsolete. 

## What is Application Guard and how does it work?
Designed for Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge, Application Guard helps to isolate enterprise-defined untrusted sites, protecting your company while your employees browse the Internet. As an enterprise administrator, you define what is among trusted web sites, cloud resources, and internal networks. Everything not on your list is considered untrusted.

If an employee goes to an untrusted site through either Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge opens the site in an isolated Hyper-V-enabled container, which is separate from the host operating system. This container isolation means that if the untrusted site turns out to be malicious, the host PC is protected, and the attacker can't get to your enterprise data. For example, this approach makes the isolated container anonymous, so an attacker can't get to your employee's enterprise credentials.

### What types of devices should use Application Guard?
Application Guard has been created to target several types of systems:

- **Enterprise desktops.** These desktops are domain-joined and managed by your organization. Configuration management is primarily done through System Center Configuration Manager or Microsoft Intune. Employees typically have Standard User privileges and use a high-bandwidth, wired, corporate network.

- **Enterprise mobile laptops.** These laptops are domain-joined and managed by your organization. Configuration management is primarily done through System Center Configuration Manager or Microsoft Intune. Employees typically have Standard User privileges and use a high-bandwidth, wireless, corporate network.

- **Bring your own device (BYOD) mobile laptops.** These personally-owned laptops are not domain-joined, but are managed by your organization through tools like Microsoft Intune. The employee is typically an admin on the device and uses a high-bandwidth wireless corporate network while at work and a comparable personal network while at home.

- **Personal devices.** These personally-owned desktops or mobile laptops are not domain-joined or managed by an organization. The user is an admin on the device and uses a high-bandwidth wireless personal network while at home or a comparable public network while outside.

IP-Literal proxy settings such as “192.168.1.4:81” can be annotated as “itproxy:81” or using a record such as “P19216810010” for a proxy with an IP address of 192.168.100.10. This applies to Windows 10 Enterprise edition, 1709 or higher.|
