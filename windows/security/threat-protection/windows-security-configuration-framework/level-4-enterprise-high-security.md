# Level 4 enterprise high security configuration

**Applies to**  

-   Windows 10

Level 4 is the security configuration recommended as a standard for devices where users access more sensitive information. These devices are a natural target in enterprises today. While targeting high levels of security, these recommendations do not assume a large staff of highly skilled security practitioners, and therefore should be accessible to most enterprise organizations.
A level 4 configuration should include all the configurations from level 5 and add the following security policies, controls, and organizational behaviors.

## Policies

The policies enforced in level 4 implement more controls and a more sophisticated security
configuration than level 5. While they may have a slightly higher impact to
users or to applications, they enforce a level of security more commensurate
with the risks facing users with access to sensitive information. Microsoft
recommends using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates) for these security configurations and
controls, with a moderate timeline that is anticipated to be slightly longer
than the process in level 5.

| Security Options       | Microsoft network client: Send unencrypted password to third party                              | Disabled                                                       | If this security setting is enabled, the Server Message Block (SMB) redirector can send plaintext passwords to non-Microsoft SMB servers that do not support password encryption during authentication. Sending unencrypted passwords is a security risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Security Options       | Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change                   | Enabled                                                        | This security setting determines if, at the next password change, the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack, as compared with the cryptographically stronger Windows NT hash. Since the LM hash is stored on the local computer in the security database the passwords can be compromised if the security database is attacked.                                                                                                                    |
| Security Options       | Network security: LAN Manager authentication level                                              | Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM                    | This security setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers as follows: Send NTLMv2 response only\\refuse LM & NTLM: Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). |
| Security Options       | Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients    | Require NTLMv2 session security and Require 128-bit encryption | This security setting allows a client to require the negotiation of 128-bit encryption and/or NTLMv2 session security. These values are dependent on the LAN Manager Authentication Level security setting value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer requires that all file-type information provided by Web servers be consistent. For example, if the MIME type of a file is text/plain but the MIME sniff indicates that the file is really an executable file, Internet Explorer renames the file by saving it in the Internet Explorer cache and changing its extension. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer requires consistent MIME data for all received files. |

### Custom Policies

| Feature           | Policy Setting                  | Policy Value            | Description            |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| MS Security Guide | Configure SMB v1 server         | Disabled                | Disable or enable server-side processing of the SMBv1 protocol  |
| MS Security Guide | Configure SMB v1 client driver  | Enabled: Disable driver | Configure the startup mode for the kernel mode driver that implements client-side SMBv1 processing (MrxSmb10). This setting includes a dropdown that is activated when the Enabled radio button is selected and that controls the “Start” registry value in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MrxSmb10.  |
| MS Security Guide | Enabled Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP)| Enabled   | This feature is designed to block exploits that use the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) overwrite technique. This protection mechanism is provided at run-time. Therefore, it helps protect applications regardless of whether they have been compiled with the latest improvements, such as the /SAFESEH option. We recommend that Windows users who are running any of the above operating systems enable this feature to improve the security profile of their systems. |
| MS Security Guide | WDigest Authentication    | Disabled    | When the WDigest Authentication protocol is enabled, plain text passwords are stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) exposing them to theft. WDigest is disabled by default in Windows 10. This setting ensures this is enforced.  |
| MS Security Guide | Block Flash activation in Office documents   | Enabled   | Prevents the Adobe Flash ActiveX control from being loaded by Office applications.  |
| MSS (Legacy)      | MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting IPv6) IP source routing protection level (Protects against packet spoofing)         | Highest Protection, source routing is completely disabled | Allowing source routed network traffic allows attackers to obscure their identity and location.     |
| MSS (Legacy)      | MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (Protects against packet spoofing)              | Highest Protection, source routing is completely disabled | Allowing source routed network traffic allows attackers to obscure their identity and location.       |
| MSS (Legacy)      | MSS: (EnableICMPRedirect) Allow ICMP redirects to override OSPF generated routes                                 | Disabled      | Allowing ICMP redirect of routes can lead to traffic not being routed properly. When disabled, this forces ICMP to be routed via shortest path first.    |
| MSS (Legacy)      | MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS servers | Enabled   | Prevents a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against a WINS server. The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS Name Release Request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the server's WINS resolution capability.        |

## Controls

The controls enforced in level 4 implement more controls and a more sophisticated security
configuration than level 5. While they may have a slightly higher impact to
users or to applications, they enforce a level of security more commensurate
with the risks facing users with access to sensitive information. Microsoft
recommends using the Audit/Enforce methodology for controls with an Audit mode,
and [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates) for those that do not, with a moderate timeline that
is anticipated to be slightly longer than the process in level 5.

| Feature Set                                                 | Feature                                               | Description    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [Exploit protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/exploit-protection-exploit-guard) | Enforce memory protection for OS-level controls: <br>- Control flow guard (CFG)<br>- Data Execution Protection (DEP)<br>- Mandatory ASLR<br>- Bottom-Up ASLR<br>- High-entropy ASLR<br>- Validate Exception Chains (SEHOP)<br>- Validate heap integrity     | Exploit protection helps protect devices from malware that use exploits to spread and infect to other devices. It consists of several mitigations that can be applied at either the operating system level, or at the individual app level. There is a risk to application compatibility, as some applications may rely on blocked behavior (e.g. dynamically generating code without marking memory as executable). Microsoft recommends gradually deploying this configuration using [the rings methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-deployment-rings-windows-10-updates).        |        
| [Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard)| Configure and enforce [Attack Surface Reduction rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard#attack-surface-reduction-rules)| Attack surface reduction controls help prevent actions and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines. There is a risk to application compatibility, as some applications may rely on blocked behavior (e.g. an Office application spawning a child process). Each control has an Audit mode, and as such, Microsoft recommends the Audit / Enforce Methodology (repeated here):<br>1) Audit – enable the controls in audit mode, and gather audit data in a centralized location<br>2) Review – review the audit data to assess potential impact (both positive and negative) and configure any exemptions from the security control you need to configure<br>3) Enforce – Deploy the configuration of any exemptions and convert the control to enforce mode |
| [Network protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/network-protection-exploit-guard) | Configure and enforce Network Protection              | Network protection helps to prevent employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet. It expands the scope of Windows Defender SmartScreen to block all outbound HTTP(s) traffic that attempts to connect to low-reputation sources (based on the domain or hostname). There is a risk to application compatibility, as a result of false positives in flagged sites. Microsoft recommends deploying using the Audit / Enforce Methodology. |

## Behaviors

The behaviors recommended in level 4 implement a more sophisticated security
process. While they may require a more sophisticated organization, they enforce
a level of security more commensurate with the risks facing users with access to
sensitive information.

| Feature Set| Feature  | Description  |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Antivirus  | Configure Protection Updates to failover to retrieval from Microsoft | Sources for Windows Defender Antivirus Protection Updates can be provided in an ordered list. If you are using internal distribution, such as SCCM or WSUS, configure Microsoft Update lower in the list as a failover.  |
| OS Security Updates | Deploy Windows Quality Updates within 4 days | As the time between release of a patch and an exploit based on the reverse engineering of that patch continues to shrink, engineering a process that provides the ability to validate and deploy quality updates addressing known security vulnerabilities is a critical aspect of security hygiene.|
| Helpdesk| 1:1 Administration| A simple and common model for helpdesk support is to add the Helpdesk group as a permanent member of the Local Administrators group of every device. If any device is compromised and helpdesk can connect to it, then these credentials can be used to obtain privilege on any / all other devices. Design and implement a strategy to provide helpdesk support without providing 1:all admin access – constraining the value of these Helpdesk credentials |
