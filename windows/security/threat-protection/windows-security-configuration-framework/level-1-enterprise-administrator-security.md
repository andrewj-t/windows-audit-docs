# Level 1 enterprise administrator workstation security configuration

**Applies to**  

-   Windows 10


Administrators (particularly of identity or security systems) present the highest risk to the organizationâˆ’through data theft, data alteration, or service disruption. 
A level 1 configuration should include all the configurations from levels 5, 4, 3, and 2 and additional controls. We are planning recommendations for the additional controls now, so check back soon for level 1 enterprise administrator security configuration guidance!
