# Level 2 enterprise dev/ops workstation security configuration
 
**Applies to**  

-   Windows 10

We recommend this configuration for developers and testers, who are an attractive target both for supply chain attacks and access to servers and systems containing high value data or where critical business functions could be disrupted. A level 2 configuration should include all the configurations from levels 5, 4, and 3 and additional controls. We are planning recommendations for the additional controls now, so check back soon for level 2 enterprise dev/ops security configuration guidance!
